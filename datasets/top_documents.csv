2,"Feedback   Subject After hours ATM - Glenferrie Road Malvern  I write to you in relation to an issue that has arisen with the ""after hours access"" to the ANZ automatic teller machine on Glenferrie road Malvern. On Saturday evening at around 8pm a friend of mine needed to take money out of her ANZ account. We drove to the ATM on Glenferrie Road Malvern in order to do so. When she accessed the machine, which required her to walk through some automatic doors, she noticed a person sleeping in the area near the machine. She felt nervous while she was using the machine and although she was able to withdraw the money she needed she continued to feel very uneasy until she was able to get back into the car. My concern with all this is that by having the machines off the street and accessed using automatic doors that do not require a card to open them that it's a prime target for a robbery. While there is security cameras in the area this is of little comfort to someone who is using the machine. A potential thief can gain automatic access to the area and commit a crime without anyone in the general public realising it. This is of even more of a concern late at night when there is no one around. Surely these areas should only be accessible by holders of ANZ cards and the automatic doors should only open when an authorised card has been swiped. With the latest technology available it is incredible that ANZ has been unable to provide a secure facility for customers to use and I am disappointed that I am having to raise this complaint.Simple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 03 FeedbackSimple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 03 Feedback"

We still currently have that property (92 Playford Avenue, Whyalla) for sale, but with the current state the town is in the market has severely declined. We requested extra time to sell the property & launched a FOS dispute (case number 4605079) & got extra time to sell this property. Unfortunately we were unable to secure a buyer & ANZ recommenced action to recoup the arrears. Due to the market in Whyalla we were told by our real estate agent, Peter Callis First National, that it may still be a while until we get a sale. We advised ANZ (through their solicitor) on 17 May 2017 that we would now put our principal place of residence (14 Cobbin Street, Port Augusta West) up for sale in order to come up with the arrears We believe this property has a greater chance of selling as the economic climate is more attracLoan hardship FOSCust accepted revised offer to clear arrears within 30 days and ANZ to waive about half enforcement exp"

6,"Transgender marriage equality    As a customer I was disappointed to note that your company is campaigning for transgender marriage. I wonder if you realise the consequences of same sec marriage bill? In the legislation marriage will be defined as between 2 people. That is mind-blowing it could mean I could marry my sister, brother or anyone who thinks they are... Confusion.            Do you realise the implications of yes outcome ? Has it occurred to you, for example, that when you go to the girls' toilets, showers or change rooms you won't know if others using the facility at the same time are boys or girls or are they boys identifying as girls and vice versus. This makes it tricky, is it safe?            When you think about it, this is far reaching because it affects all public places e.g. malls, entertainment, travel, recreation, and so on.            It will affect freedom of speech, which we are witnessing in Australia already, and will have repercussions in all areas of our life. It will be especially hurtful to those children who will be stripped of their right to be brought up by their biological parents .      All children will be subjected to safe schools programme right down to preschools. This is not imagination, one only has to look at countries that have adopted this type of legislation to see what will happen in the event of a yes vote. Safe Schools legislation is already operating in some states.This is not the sort of education that parents want for their children.            I urge you to think again. This is legislation which changes the whole meaning of the word Marriage.Simple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template  54 ANZ support of marriage equalitySimple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template  54 ANZ support of marriage equality"

7,"Subject Lack of Customer care , service skills , people skills and dangerously exposing of identity in a Public Domain  On the 8th of September on Friday morning , I walked into the Leichhardt branch of ANZ which is located at MktPlace Leichhardt to simply get some personal account details, but instead was faced with a situation which left me in shock and disbelief and still frustrates me to this moment.   When I walked into the bank I took a couple of numbers from the customer number box for I wasnt sure who I was suppose to see for my inquiry.   As I was waiting , a few minutes later I was called into a office by a young woman .As I approached her I asked her if she could give me my account details and she said yes she can.    Followng her I sat on the chair opposite her at her desk. As I handed her my ANZ keycard I knew and was aware that I would need some other form of id which in this case I gave her my Drivers Licence and with 100% confidence that its sufficient proof enough and without another thought was getting ready to recieve the information which I was there for.   She then asked me what my security code was , which I have not been asked before and of course I couldnt remember it . She didn't ask any probing questions which might have supported me remembering my password so as a result I couldnt anwer her correctly. I understand and respect the strict measures involved for security reasons.   She then continued to ask me, if I wanted her to tell me what my security code was and I said no , Because she was so loud and I felt very unsecure with the way she was handling the situation and with also her `so layed back attitude' . I then asked her to write it down for me and at the same time reminded her that I didn't even know her from a bar of soap ,she said oh here , picking up I suppose her business card turning it over and writing my security code on it ,while she continued to ask for information which was quite irrelavent to my initial inquiry and which was also continuing to expose my identity unnecessarily mind you ,whilst everyone in the waiting room could also hear what was gong on with us.    As a result it almost took me an hour or so from first contact to the final stage of getting my personal account details ,which were only two things a BSB and account number.   Even at this stage there were no apologies or even any attempts for it.   There weren't even any acknowledgements of the situation being carried out so erratically.   I understand that there's company policy to adhere to when giving out sensitive information, but when a customer provides you with a drivers license containing a photo and address that matches the details on your system, there should be no further query. Even if additional information was required, I have all the right to be treated in a respectful manner, not be made out to be a fool infront of staff and other customers.    I then asked if that question is usually asked for something as little as ?asking for `account details' she said ?yes"" . She said even if I were to go up to the teller that they would do the same thing.Poor Service experience.I apologise for the poor experience received, I advise will pass on the feedback to the relevant areas for review."

The loans were to be split according to Mr Wilke, and loan ending 1701 should have been set up in Jennifer's name with Martin being guarantor, and loan ending  3527 being set up in Martin's name with Jennifer being a guarantor.   The reason for having loans set up this way is to reflect the share of debt Martin and Jennifer are responsible for. Martin also wanted to use his ANZ Offset account ending  7211 to offset loan ending 3527 . I explained to him in July when enquired, that this offset account cannot be linked as the loan is in joint names, hence offset account would also need to be set up in exactly the same names. Martin mentioned his loan has been previously linked to offset account and has dropped off or rather cancelled offsetting, and he requesting for linkage again and it was offsetting the loan again until he dropped off. He then met me in July, where I clarified offsetting will not be possible for him.   Today he came in again to follow up why his loan is not offsetting and I explained to him what I did in July, and also had a look this time to notice the title of property is held in Jennifer's name only hence I can understand why being set up as guarantor for each other's loans would not have been possible.

I explained to him in July when enquired, that this offset account cannot be linked as the loan is in joint names, hence offset account would also need to be set up in exactly the same names. Martin mentioned his loan has been previously linked to offset account and has dropped off or rather cancelled offsetting, and he requesting for linkage again and it was offsetting the loan again until he dropped off. He then met me in July, where I clarified offsetting will not be possible for him.   Today he came in again to follow up why his loan is not offsetting and I explained to him what I did in July, and also had a look this time to notice the title of property is held in Jennifer's name only hence I can understand why being set up as guarantor for each other's loans would not have been possible.   Martin is hoping to get reimbursed for interest he has been paying on loan which he should not have been paying for considering he was offsetting the loan by 100% throughout from May 2016 until now. He has Today paid his share of loan off in full, and wants to have interest he has paid so far to be reimbursed to him in to his offset account. I explained I am not able to do this for him, and he should speak to customer resolution but he said I should do this on his behalf and explain what has happened.    Martin explains the loans were never supposed to have been set up in joint names and it is not his fault if this was set up the way it is. He also did not seem to be aware the property title was only in Jennifer's name and said he will need to correct that as well which I advised, would be done through landgate and that fees would apply.   Please contact Martin on 0408090766 to discuss this further. If you need any clarification from me, you can email or call me as per my details below.Interest dispute- as a result of offset account not linkedagreed to a once off goodwill payment of $652.80 and advised feedback will be provided to the branch sla of  2-3 bus days for the funds to in his offset account advised i will send him signed LOOs"

26,"ANZ Support of Marriage Equality  Why are you supporting transgender marriage?                     Changing marriage laws for homosexuals to marry is religious persecution?      It came to my attention when listening to the argument for same sex marriage that Homosexuality is nothing more than a belief system, not unlike any other.       To be homosexual you need to believe you are homosexual, it is not a science! Nor is it testable. It is a belief in ones identity, much like someone who believes they are Christian and derives their identity from the presence of God in their life.       Marriage is a core belief in a Christian's identity and I believe homosexuality is attempting to usurp Christianity by trying to redefine the term ?marriage"" as a universal term for anyone to use, where it is historically a cornerstone of a heterosexual relationship and Christian faith. If Homosexuals were allowed to use the word marriage to define their relationships, the ability to have faith and believe in the Bible would be compromised because the bible clearly says that God deplores Homosexuality.      In the Bible homosexuality is condemned as an immoral and unnatural sin. Leviticus 1822 identifies homosexual sex as an abomination, a detestable sin. Romans 126-27 declares homosexual desires and actions to be shameful, unnatural, lustful, and indecent. First Corinthians 69 states that homosexuals are unrighteous and will not inherit the kingdom of God. Homosexual desires and actions are condemned in the Bible, and it is clear that homosexuals ?marrying"" is not God's will, and would be, in fact, sinful. Yet homosexuals will argue they have a right to be married.       In the 2016 census Christianity was by far the most common religion in Australia 52% (the next most common groups, Islam and Buddhism were at 2% each).       Yet cake shops and wedding organiser's, venue operators and churches alike all developed around a Christian ethos are being forced to serve an ideology which is not their own and if they don't comply they are being threatened with legal action.       If homosexuals want to develop their own cultural institutions, rituals and ceremonies, to celebrate their identity and their relationships that's their prerogative, but who would condone they take an already existing legal and cultural identity and call it their own?Simple Complaint case actioned by BLR - Template #54, Complaint type ANZ Support of Marriage EqualitySimple Complaint case actioned by BLR - Template #54, Complaint type ANZ Support of Marriage Equality"

Furthermore, the world is at a point where we need to rapidly transition away from polluting fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy if we are to avoid runaway climate change.

34,Today 16/1/18 I waited over 20 mts to do some banking at the ANZ Bank in Endeavour Hills Vic.      There was quite a lot of people waiting to be served. Of course we had tickets.      Whilst one of the tellers carried on an extended conversation with a customer who was opening out an account and another teller who I think was more senior in position just stood along side & was listening.      I did speak up & tell the teller why don't you take the customers into your little office's when you know it is going to a long service. To which she replied we did not know it was going to be long until we started serving the customer. She also said to me you could use the atm outside.Simple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 1 - Poor Service - Individual	Simple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 1 - Poor Service - Individual

We work inside the Hyperdome and my staff no longer wish to go to the bank for me in case they have to get served by her. We too work in a customer service based job and regardless of how we are feeling on the day and or whether we enjoy our job, we pride ourselves on not reflecting this to clients while working.

35,"ANZ Visa Platinum Credit Card dissatisfaction  I want to let you know about a recent event with me travelling overseas and the use of my credit card.  I recently travelled to Micronesia for a Scuba Diving holiday. I advised the ANZ bank that I was travelling there and a note was placed in the system.  I tried to pay my accommodation bill $465 USD and dive shop bill $1502 USD and both were refused. I did not have phone access on this remote place to call the +61 3 96837043 to report the problem. I also did not receive the text sent by ANZ to advise that there was a transaction taking place in Micronesia as i did not have mobile phone reception.  So, I managed to pay these 2 bills with some embarresment amongst the help of my friends. BTW one of my friends paid bills with his NAB Visa. I travelled all around Europe for 3 months in 2015 without a glitch on my same card.  On my return I visited the ANZ bank to try and figure out why I had this problem on my Card while travelling. The end response from ANZ was that the transactions were to high and the card had not been used at these facilities before. I have thought this over and just think given the circumstances this is just not acceptable and I certainly don't want it to happen again.  In Australia I use my ANZ credit Card for almost all transactions without a problem.  Now I am going to Raja Ampat (Indonesia) and then Bali in October. Will this be a problem?

35,"Simple Complaint  Poor Service  I've spent a lot of money through your credit cards. I call to reset my phone pin so that i can get through seamlessly because it took far too long to get through, and cannot do it unless i listen to a whole directory of automated options, which have managed to take me to the wrong place 2 times and wasted my time. When i get through to a person, they cant help me, rather direct me to just listen to the automated options again. If this was AMEX or Citi, their systems and processes would empower their staff to help me, rather than palm me off to an outdated automated voice system. Money is the biggest commodity and i can buy it somewhere else, and i will. An example with AMEX where i was delighted i was putting off calling them because i expected service like the one that i get at ANZ. when i called, i spoke to a real person within a minute, they were upbeat, listened to what i had to say and were responsive and consultative to help me resolve the issue at hand. they sold me another credit card, which i was so happy to sign up to, probably dindt need it, but now use it heavily BECAUSE they were so fantastic to me! apart from boasting about them AMEX to you, i boasted about the delightful experience to my friends because i honestly didnt expect it. More importantly, the reason i went with ANZ is because of the dual AMEX-Visa account, and now i can only use Visa, yet still pay the same annual fee to use the service - not commercially viable, and i feel ripped off. This was the original reason why i rang (and took ages to get through because of the phone pin issue), and the person on the phone gave me a shoulder shrug, didn't even try to retain my business. This entire experience left a bad taste in my mouth with ANZ. From the conversations i had with your staff, they didnt seem to want to help retain me as a customer - it's a stark contrast to how i'm treated at AMEX and citi; and although they are more expensive options, i will pay premium to have a 10/10 customer experience. train you staff to WANT to retain customers, rather than offer a shoulder shrug reaction when a customer asks for help - enable real people to help resolve problems, rather than buck passing to outdated automated menu which takes way too much time to listen through - rethink your pricing when restructuring your commercial offerings (i.e. when you take a value add out of your offering, price that in) Be more customer-centric - i'm not sure if it's one of your values, it certainly doesn't feel like one.Simple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 1 ?

I lined up as I wanted to link my accounts tommy new credit card and transfer a balance. When I finally got to the front the lady informed me she couldn't do this and I had to go back to enquires . I have no idea why this was an enquiry when previously I have been able to have help from the desk. I then went to enquires and had to wait as no one was at the counter. I'm currently sitting in your waiting room waiting for someone to help me. Meanwhile now here is no line at the teller and 3 staff (none of which now help with everyday banking)?? I don't know what has happened but this is confusing , inefficient and frustrating.       I would like to know why my every day banking needs can no longer be helped at the teller counter and now I have to que for what has been over 20 mins whilst staring at staff who are doing nothing .Customer was not happy with the service at the branch which was inconvenient for her.Emailed an apology letter to the customer."
