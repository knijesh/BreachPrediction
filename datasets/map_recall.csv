1693,COM-102361,COM-102361_1,Breakfree package Terms and Conditions not clear- Rewards Fee charged when part of Breakfree package,"Customer stated he was provided with ANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum credit card, which would not be charged an annual fee conditional of him paying the Annual Breakfree package Fee. Customer says he has not been charged an annual credit card fee for approximately 20 years. In August 2017, the Applicant noticed that he had been charged an annual fee of $110. When he enquired, although ANZ was willing to waive the fee, he was told without explanation that the credit card would attract an annual fee on an ongoing basis. The Applicant is of the opinion that ANZ are providing misleading information to potential customers in the advertising of home loan stating that there will be no annual fee on the ANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum credit card. Applicant is also of the opinion that ANZ is in breach of the loan agreement. Applicant stated that nowhere in the agreement does it state that the annual Breakfree fee will attract additional credit card fees.

Interestingly although the loan was 'new' the time period was set at 30 years minus the 8 years we had held the interest only mortgage ?	We 'missed' our first mortgage payment on the new loan as we hadn't set up a direct monthly payment for this new loan, as compared to the monthly payment that we had in place for the last 8 years which ANZ vary with interest rate changes When a change in policy at your end costs us money without notice or discussion, I think you have got it wrong in terms of building any sort of loyalty.

As discussed on 28 November 2017, I have reversed $742.25 of cash advance interest fees to your account.  As a way of clarification, A cash advance (for example, if you take out cash from an ATM and select `credit? as the account type, or a cash equivalent transaction such as the purchase of gambling chips) will always attract interest, regardless of whether you have interest free periods on your credit card account.  With cash advances it?s important to know that interest will generally be charged from the date of the cash advance and will continue to be charged on the outstanding cash advances balance until you pay off that transaction balance (including any previously billed interest, fees and charges) in full.  You may avoid being charged interest on a cash advance if your credit card account is in credit (by at least the amount of the cash advance) at the time of the cash advance. Your account may be in credit if, for example, you have previously paid more off your account than you owe.  ANZ appreciates your feedback, as it is through instances such as these that we are able to review and improve our service to enable a superior customer experience.

Though, customer's CRN has been deregistered in Finacle, which may have been the root cause i.e. CRN deregistered rather than ANZ Shield.Offered to credit customer $125.00 as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience caused and to retain a customer who has been banking with us for less than a year and customer declined the offer instead he wanted the funds donated to charity and be sent a receipt with evidence of the donation, advised customer we can not facilitate that and will credit him if he accepts the offer then he can donate to a charity of his choice and advised customer if he does change his mind he can contact us and sent customer a letter to that effect.18.2",1.0,1.0

12588,COM-479269,COM-479269_2,Customer is looking for refund of $700 for settlement of fixed Home loan which was calculated incorrectly.,"Concern# 1 Customer is looking for a refund of $700; On 29 September customer sold his house and repaid the ANZ mortgage. The mortgage consisted of 5 parts two were on variable rate and three were fixed rate. The variable loans were cleared as expected, but there was a charge payable on two of the fixed rates as the interest rates of the fixed rate higher than the then prevailing interest rates. There was no charge on the third fixed rate tranche as the fixed interest rate was lower than the then prevailing interest rate.  Details of the fixed rate tranches were as follows  1. Tranche 1 Fixed rate tranche maturing 18Sept19 at 4.99% giving a loss payable by customer  on the Fixed Rate of approx. $9k  2. Tranche 2 Fixed rate tranche maturing 27Nov18 with account number ending in 82682 at 4.29% giving a loss payable by customer on the Fixed Rate of $605.01  3. Tranche 3 Fixed rate tranche maturing 2Nov18 (i.e. the same month as the above Fixed Rate tranche) with account number ending in 83597 at 3.75% - no charge required for customer to pay as it was in-the-money.  It is reasonably simple to work out that the interest rate used to calculate the loss on Tranche 2 was approx. 3.95%. Given the 3.75% tranche matured in the same month, then the interest rate used to calculate the loss (or gain) on closing this tranche would also have been approx. 3.95% as well. By customer calculation, ANZ therefore profited by close to $700 from closing the 3.75% tranche and this profit should have then been paid to customer.   Customer was always aware in the lead up to the sale of the house that losses on Tranches 1 & 2 were out-of-the-money would be partially offset by a gain on Tranche 3 that was in-the-money. Customer was both surprised and upset that when Tranche 3 was closed, no gain was paid, despite ANZ making a gain on closing that tranche.  Concern#2 on the settlement of the house, money was paid to customer on 29 September.

I originally opened this account as a Classic Visa with the rewards program in 1997. My account has run continually under the rewards program for over 20 years without any blemishes to it's record. Every month the balance has cleared for the full amount owing on the closing balance. In 2012, I received a letter from yourselves offering my account to be transferred a ANZ Platinum Visa at no additional cost. I enquired about any additional charges in the future, as it meant closing my excisting cards & new cards issuing. At the time, I possessed a Visa Card & an American Express Card, linked to the same account. In the last year, I received an email to say the American Express Card had been discontinued.       When I received my December Visa statement, I was dismayed to see a annual fee of $240. Since the card was issued to me as a Platinum account, I have been charged an annual fee of $40.00, plus the Rewards Program fee of $55.00. I have a copies of statements from December 2012 to December 2016 which show these charges. If you check my records, you will see this is correct. I enquired with your staff by telephone, & was advised that the fee on my card was charged according the the status of the account ,i.e. a Platinum Visa.

I visited an ANZ branch this morning to cancel said bank chÃ¨que and was advised there would be a fee of $25 to cancel. I find this fee quite disproportionate to the amount of the actual bank chÃ¨que. I realise the chÃ¨que is a nominal amount however having already had to pay for a new chÃ¨que with correct payee details which incurred a $15 fee, and now a $25 fee to cancel the chÃ¨que I find these fees excessive. Can you please consider allowing me to cancel the bank chÃ¨que with zero fees.    Fee waived for bank chÃ¨que cancellation.Fees associated with bank chequesAcknowledged concerns. Explanation sent.

26520,COM-502449,COM-502449_1,ANZ will not release CDA covering IG which was lost and company deregistered,"I owned a business which had a bank guarantee as a security deposit made to the landlord at the time 'Abanack Properties Pty Ltd'. I sold the business on 19 Jan 2018. The landlord Abanack Properties sold the freehold to a new landlord in 2015. During the sale, the leasing agent Gross Waddell misplaced the guarantee and they can no longer get in touch with the initial landlord. ANZ is refusing to release my guarantee even after considering - I have the original copy of the guarantee - The landlord Abanack Properties de-registered his company in April 2016. - I no longer own the business and the new tenant has provided the new landlord with a new guarantee - I have all the documents including a letter from the leasing agent stating that the guarantee was lost. My case has gone through multiple people in ANZ and lastly reached the complaints resolution centre. Their final request was for me to get a letter from ASIC stating that there is nothing owning on the previous landlords company. Although this did not make sense to me, I contacted ASIC regardless and got a written email response stating that a company cannot be de-registered without clearing all debts. I forwarded this email from ASIC onto ANZ on March 19 2018 to Kashmir Singh from the complaints department. My email was simply ignored and nobody bothered to ring me back. I finally requested to speak to another team member David who advised that nothing was done with my email and he had just forwarded onto the management and legal team (16 April 2018). I rang David on 23 April 2018 and was advised that the management at ANZ are still not satisfied with the response from ASIC. As you can see, I have been going in circles with ANZ for over 3 months and I desperately need to close the account so our shareholders can be paid out the dividends. I am getting charged monthly on keeping my accounts open with them and on top of that they have also charged me another $250 bank guarantee yearly IG fee ! I believe ANZ needs to release my guaranteee ASAP as it is my money to begin with and there is no claim on it now that the landlord has de-registered. In all fairness ANZ should compensate for - All the monthly account charges from January 2018 until the day they release my guarantee - Refund the yearly guarantee CBIG fee as I have requested the release in January only to be charge for another year on 09 Feb 2018. - The loss in having to keep my accountant on, my XERO accounting subscription software running all because I cannot finalize and close my bank accounts. - The run around for over 3 months speaking to either the wrong people and not getting the correct and/or timely response. - Being told to contact irrelevant parties such as ASIC for a response that is nothing more than common sense. - The long and stressful few months which is taking it's toll both emotionally and mentally.","ANZ cancel IG and release TD restraint, plus paid $250 compo",33,"I owned a business which had a bank guarantee as a security deposit made to the landlord at the time 'Abanack Properties Pty Ltd'. I sold the business on 19 Jan 2018. The landlord Abanack Properties sold the freehold to a new landlord in 2015. During the sale, the leasing agent Gross Waddell misplaced the guarantee and they can no longer get in touch with the initial landlord. ANZ is refusing to release my guarantee even after considering - I have the original copy of the guarantee - The landlord Abanack Properties de-registered his company in April 2016. - I no longer own the business and the new tenant has provided the new landlord with a new guarantee - I have all the documents including a letter from the leasing agent stating that the guarantee was lost.

I have attempted to resolve the matter, and ANZ have not complied or negotiated with me regarding said charges. The circumstances are as follows An ANZ access account was set up for the purpose of a Personal Loan after the loan amount was paid, under my understanding and notification this account was supposed to be closed - it was not. ANZ have continued to charge fees to this account, when no transactions or transfers have occurred since the initial lump sum one off loan payment 20th November 2017. and when there were no funds in there a hefty fee in total of $279.42 was placed against my account. At no time, was there any communication with myself, regarding these ongoing interest, overdrawn and transfer fees for an account that was not being actively utilised by myself As of the date the personal loan was completed and not touched since 20th November 2017. I have been charged a total of $344.47 I have attempted to resolve the matter on a number of occasions after months of communication with ANZ, ANZ decided that a one-off payment of $66 would reimbursed on the 12th April, regardless of the $344.47 fees I've been charged however, on the 23rd April ANZ applied a $65 transfer fee to my account.

I am happy to provide ANZ with all the documentation that it requires to substantiate this amount of over-charging","Dear ANZ Formal Complaints Dept, I am writing to request a reversal and repayment of monies that had been paid by our business, Lawriwsky Pty Ltd, to ANZ over the course of several years. As a content aggregator for Amazon.com, we have been receiving cheques from Amazon's US, UK and European arms over several years. We were charged a $15 per cheque clearance fee as long as the value remained under AUD2000.00 per cheque, but once these cheques increased to over that amount a fee in the vicinity of $100-$110 was charged for each cheque. This, we were told, was to pay for the cheques to be sent to London, ""cleared"" there, and then sent back. In addition to the incremental transaction cost, this delayed us receiving the payments for approximately a month. I have identified 39 such cheques, which we paid ANZ $4,110.47 to clear over the period 2015-2017. The cost should have been only $585 (39 x $15). As a result, we were over-charged by $3,525.47. I complained to ANZ staff handling these transactions on many occasions, arguing that because they were coming regularly every month, and were from a credible source (largest listed company in the world), they should not be subject to such a procedure and ANZ's exorbitant fee. I kept being told there was no way to avoid it. Some months ago, as a result of a restructuring of our business, I had to change to another bank to receive the same stream of Amazon cheques, which were all over AUD2,000. The other bank has been charging a normal fee, and as provided the money to us immediately, so our costs have reduced. It then became apparent that I had been misinformed by the ANZ Bank, and over-charged all that time. I therefore formally request that ANZ repay to Lawriwsky Pty Ltd the amount of $3,525.47 that was over-charged during 2015-17. I am happy to provide ANZ with all the documentation that it requires to substantiate this amount of over-charging.

28027,COM-509729,COM-509729_1,Allegations of a corrupt application. Customer advises that the payslips submitted were forged and asks why ANZ failed to verify this.,"To Whom It May Concern,   About  two weeks ago my employer has called me for an inquiry about submitting forged pay slips to ANZ bank.   During this investigation I found that these payslips were used in the loan we have received from ANZ back in Nov 2017.  Loan account Number 013-885681194823  My wife sent all the relevant details to the broker  ( Hasitha Dharmasena) we have engaged for this loan back in Oct 17. Since we have used him earlier (not long ago) to refinance our home loan, this time he only asked to send the latest 2 payslips, PAYG summary, rental statements and sales of contract.   In between he came once to my son's swimming pool to get my signature for the application and then somewhere in Nov 17, i received the approved offer. i went to his house to sign  the documents.   My wife called the broker on the same day i had my inquiry to get an explanation on how forge payslips were submitted to bank.  His answer was this application went as a direct bank application rather than his broker system.  He mentioned that his friend works in the ANZ Warragul branch (Lasitha Amarasooriya) has lodged the application on behalf of us.  The broker denies now that he has anything to do with this application.   My employer wants some evidence that i didn't do this. so far i have shown them the e-mail i sent to the broker with required details.   To clear my name, i went to Glen Waverly branch and asked advice on what should i do on this. Their lending specialist advised me to write an e-mail to the person investigating this at ANZ.    I have done that on 31st of May 18 providing copy of my initial e-mail  to the broker to her. ANZ person who i have sent the e-mail was Evalyn Pachos. My employer has provided me her details as she is the one contacted them.  i have also called her and left a message to ring me back.  She returned my call two days after, however she said she can't help much on providing any evidence to clear my name on forging the payslips because this application was processed as a direct rather than through a broker.  I have sent another e-mail to her with further details to prove that i have engaged the broker for this and i have never deal directly with the bank. Again called her on Tuesday 5th June to ask whether any help with the information i have provided. She mentioned that she has forwarded my e-mails to another department but bank can't provide any assistance on clearing my name. She suggested to go to Police.   So i went to police on last Saturday (9th Jun 18) to report it. Police said they can't take my entry as bank should report this to police rather than me.   I am going round and round with no help.   Would you please look into this and let me know;  	Why bank has not checked my documents at the time of lodging the application back in Nov 17? 	Why bank never gave me a chance to explain what had happened first? 	Why this is investigated after 6 months of approving the loan? 	What trigger to investigate this? We never default with payments.  	If bank now say this is a direct application from us, why they never contact us directly for anything? 	Why bank even sent my online login details to the broker? 	Can bank check whether they have received any e-mails from our broker? 	If this is a direct application, why bank has paid a commission to ""Sight Creations""? who are they? 	Can you check from the person who signed our loan offer, Lasitha Amarasooriya how he received the information?     My understanding is i have became a victim of a corrupted banking system. i have trusted this broker and blindly signed some documents assuming he would do the right thing. Broker has used our details for one of your employees and his financial gain. But now the broker say he has nothing to do with this and he still continue his work as a broker.

As a result the interest charged in a particular month could be higher even if the owing balance is lower, because of the number of days accrued within that month.  For example, the number of days accrued in the statement ending 23 July 2017 was  of 27 days.  However on the next statement for the period ending 23 August 2017, the number of days accrued was 30 days.    As you can notice there was two more days of interest accrual between the above-mentioned statement periods.  As your daily interest is  20.99 % per annum, for the extra two days the interest which would have been the difference of $11.74 between the two statements.  -	For Aussie credit cards, your repayments are allocated to pay off purchase transactions prior to cash advances.  To ensure interest does not continue to accrue on your credit card, the full owing balance is required to be paid by the payment due date advised on your statement.  Our review of your statements have showed the interest on cash advances has continued to accrue over the years as the full owing balance has not been paid.  -	An interest adjustment of $802.00 was credited to your credit card in February 2017.  The interest credit adjustment relates to interest charged on previously billed interest in connection with cash advances and related cash advance fees.  ANZ identified some accounts that required interest credit adjustments for interest charges during the period August 2006 to March 2014.  Based on the above investigation, we believe the interest charges have been correctly calculated and ANZ has organised a credit adjustment to rectify any previous cash advance charges discrepancies.  However, we have been unable to determine whether the extra interest charges would have been accounted for in the interest adjustment amount of $802.00.  Therefore, as a once off goodwill gesture, we have agreed to a goodwill payment of $200.00 to cover for any extra credit card insurance charges during the period August 2006 to March 2014.  We have also attached the credit card statements for the last seven years.  Please be advised the statements have been password protected for security reasons.

As a result the interest charged in a particular month could be higher even if the owing balance is lower, because of the number of days accrued within that month.  For example, the number of days accrued in the statement ending 23 July 2017 was  of 27 days.  However on the next statement for the period ending 23 August 2017, the number of days accrued was 30 days.    As you can notice there was two more days of interest accrual between the above-mentioned statement periods.  As your daily interest is  20.99 % per annum, for the extra two days the interest which would have been the difference of $11.74 between the two statements.  -	For Aussie credit cards, your repayments are allocated to pay off purchase transactions prior to cash advances.
