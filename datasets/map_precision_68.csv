The process and I believe the purpose of internet banking is to streamline banking for customers and reduce staff time and administration costs for the bank - a win/win outcome. I do not believe that the current process (or policy if that exists) for credit card accounts supports the internet banking objectives and is not fair for customers. A change in process so that all credit card transaction history for an account is not removed from the customer simply because a card is stopped. If the same logic (for want of a definition) is applied to a cheque account where the actual cheque book is cancelled then the customer would lose all information pertaining to the account!Simple Complaints actioned by BLR - Template 3 - FeedbackSimple Complaints actioned by BLR - Template 3 - Feedback33",0.0,0.0

It was on two term deposits where interest is paid monthly.

My mother will just have to wait until next year to get the money back when she does a tax return. Funnily enough one of the taxes has been put back into the term deposit account but the other cannot be done.

My father passed away on the 28.5.2017 and your branch was notified within a week of his passing.   Since then I have visited the branch on numerous occasions to draw bank cheques to pay for my fathers funeral and on 2 occasions I have supplied his will and death certificate on both times the branch had rung the deceased estate for information.   I even had the solicitor who has my fathers will on file contact the bank to finalise his account being closed and transferred but the bank would not respond to them.   So I took my mother who happens to be terminally ill with cancer out of her nursing home to see the branch manager with dads will and death certificate in July to get his financial statements because we needed this information for her nursing home placement.    That part of your process was stressful enough for my mum and our family but to get to October and for me to make a phone call on 5.10.17 to your deceased estate team and find out that your Hamilton branch had yet to forward the will and death certificate I think is absolutely beyond words. I got told that the deceased estate team had emailed the branch and requested the information.   On 9.10.17 I again contacted your deceased estate team to get an update only to be told that the branch had emailed back that they had the paperwork and would post it.   I cannot believe that in this day and age that your branch could not just email this paperwork.   The lady I spoke to in your deceased estate team on the 9.10 was really good as I explained the urgency of this matter to her. Because your bank and branch had been so inactive in their duty my mothers cancer has progressed to the point she will pass away any day now.   So I'm sure you could understand the stress myself and my family are under, so to ring your deceased estate team today to find out that only because I rang today they will commence the draft of the first letter and to be only now told that even though my mother is still alive your bank will not accept me signing her paperwork even though I hold her power of attorney which does lawfully allow me to do this. And to add insult to this whole process I now have only been informed that I need to leave my mothers bedside to travel 2 hours to get the other executor sign a form even though my fathers will specifically states that everything he owned transferred straight to his wife.   My fathers bank account was the primary account for him and his wife and to be now faced with trying to find money to pay for a funeral for our mother because of your banks total incompetence is just not acceptable.   I do expect a response to this email with the actions you are taking. I do expect the branch manager to be held totally accountable for the stress and emotional roller coaster my family has been through because of your branch.

I was at the bank at roughly 12.45pm firstly the ticket machine was out of order one of the Workers was standing at the door letting people know were to go.. There was only 2 tellers open. I asked the guy standing at the door where to go as I need to withdraw cash so he sent me to sit down with the people waiting few people after walked in the also sat and then one other customer comes in and he easily send him one of the tellers that were open not having to wait at all. A lady waiting before me asked as to why he walked in so easily and went through to the tellers and his reason was that he had a business account she??a??a??s like it shouldn??a??a??t matter we all have things to do and he should wait like the rest of the rest of us. Usually there is a teller for business accounts in other banks however there was no sign to show that there was one at the ANZ branch in Fairfield. I stood up and told him my account is also a business account he goes no you don??a??a??t have a business account which I clearly do! Then rudely said ok go through before all these people however I refused to do so as there was a fair bit of people waiting before me and just told him that everyone should wait in line according to how they walked in as the ticket machine was out of order! The whole bank was all over the place and no routine only 2 tellers open at midday and the worker at the door was lost as of what to do! A bank like ANZ shouldn??a??a??t have a ticket machine out of order yes it happens for a day or so but it has been out of order for over 3weeks plus the worker at the door should be aware of what he is saying and what he is doing and not let people go in according to who he knows and who he dosnt. I then went to the ANZ in Cabramatta there is no ticket machine but the bank was running smoothly people were lined up and knew what they were doing.

A lady waiting before me asked as to why he walked in so easily and went through to the tellers and his reason was that he had a business account she??a??a??s like it shouldn??a??a??t matter we all have things to do and he should wait like the rest of the rest of us. Usually there is a teller for business accounts in other banks however there was no sign to show that there was one at the ANZ branch in Fairfield. I stood up and told him my account is also a business account he goes no you don??a??a??t have a business account which I clearly do! Then rudely said ok go through before all these people however I refused to do so as there was a fair bit of people waiting before me and just told him that everyone should wait in line according to how they walked in as the ticket machine was out of order! The whole bank was all over the place and no routine only 2 tellers open at midday and the worker at the door was lost as of what to do! A bank like ANZ shouldn??a??a??t have a ticket machine out of order yes it happens for a day or so but it has been out of order for over 3weeks plus the worker at the door should be aware of what he is saying and what he is doing and not let people go in according to who he knows and who he dosnt. I then went to the ANZ in Cabramatta there is no ticket machine but the bank was running smoothly people were lined up and knew what they were doing. The problem isn??a??a??t in the ticket machine it??a??a??s the knowledge of the workers that was standing at the door... fix service employ more stuffSimple Complaint actioned by BLR - Template 1 ?

With the branch previously inside the Mount Gravatt Central now closed, today I had to waste a lot of time looking for another ATM, the one inside Garden City is extremely inconvenient, I have arthiritis in my hip that prevents walking long distances, and I generally find that center very confusing. There was another along Logan Rd on google is that is no longer there. I ended up driving to Woolloongabba to use the smart ATM there and that ATM struggled to take my notes, it seemed slightly malfuncyioning, normally there is a clunk when the notes are inserted to pullthem into the machine. This one did not have that and instead it felt like I just place the note of a conveyor belt with no traction. Then because of the humidity from all the rain, I had to feed each note in one by one because the machines are incapable of separating the notes. All in all a very unpleasant experience.

Given the payout figure is nearly $900, and that ANZ had contributed to delays at every stage of settlement, I ask you to investigate this further and get in touch with me on the below contact details. You can start where I did, with Fil (who was very helpful) and follow this tag #URN231020171130. If the issue is not addressed suitably, I will take steps to raise the issue outside of ANZ. As a current customer I feel angry to be in this position.Incorrect advice when not provided a Paypout figure for loan closure. Customer not aware of outstanding interest and fees charged to account.I called customer and apologised for delay in responding. I advised I will credit the account and close with a NIL balance.

On 17/2/17, We emailed ANZ requesting a reduction in our interest rate. After receiving no follow up telephone contact from ANZ, on 20/02/17, we telephoned ANZ and spoke to a gentleman named ALF. We negotiated a 1% reduction in the interest rate and a promise that it would be implement by the next month and back dated to the 20/12/2016. This would have reduced the interest rate from 5.22% to 4.22%. This was not actioned.             In late March or early April, we telephoned ANZ to complain that the promised 1% rate reduction had not been implemented. Regrettably, I did not write down the gentleman?s name that we spoke to on this occasion, he advise that the system would not permit the interest rate to be backdated to 20/12/16, but that the 1% reduction in the interest rate would be implemented within the next month.

On 17/2/17, We emailed ANZ requesting a reduction in our interest rate. After receiving no follow up telephone contact from ANZ, on 20/02/17, we telephoned ANZ and spoke to a gentleman named ALF. We negotiated a 1% reduction in the interest rate and a promise that it would be implement by the next month and back dated to the 20/12/2016. This would have reduced the interest rate from 5.22% to 4.22%. This was not actioned.             In late March or early April, we telephoned ANZ to complain that the promised 1% rate reduction had not been implemented. Regrettably, I did not write down the gentleman?s name that we spoke to on this occasion, he advise that the system would not permit the interest rate to be backdated to 20/12/16, but that the 1% reduction in the interest rate would be implemented within the next month. We expected the interest rate to be reduced 4.22%. This was not actioned.             On Friday, 13th or 20th October 2017, we went into the ANZ Branch at the Maddington Shopping Centre and spoke to 2 ANZ staff members, one being Ms Jan Smith-Weaver (the Home Investment Lending Manager). We explained the history of promised interest rate reductions and the lack of implementation by the ANZ. The ANZ interest rate was 5.21%, and that we are now actively looking in the market for a better interest rate. Again, we were promise a 0.6% rate reduction, and again it would not be backdated, but it may take a little while (a week or 2 weeks was my impression, but cannot state that was promised). We expected the interest rate to be reduced to 4.61%. This was not actioned, and the interest rate remains unchanged at 5.21%.             Today, 14/11/17, we rang ANZ and the only section able to assist us has close, as it is 5.15pm in Western Australia and after 8.00pm in Sydney and Melbourne.

I have since been awaiting my new card, and have just found out that it has again been sent to the business address. This is not the first time the bank has done this to me. After I moved out of my old address in Carr Street - the bank continued sending my mail for some accounts there - and I have no idea who's hands this mail ended up in.

8998,COM-114515,COM-114515_1,credit card application and poor service received,"I went into the ANZ branch on the 15th of November for a credit card application and I wanted to raise awareness of the terrible customer service and advise that I have received. For full disclosure I worked as a personal banker at The Bank Of Melbourne so I understand how the systems and processes work.            I went into the branch to apply for a black credit card as I had just accepted a new job that would involve a lot of flying and as such I did my research and decided that I wanted the status credits available under your special offer. I was a bit worried that I seemed to know the credit card terms and conditions better than the person doing the application but I thought that it wouldn't matter as I knew the fine print and how the special promotions worked regarding the credit card special offers (even tho the specialist didn't seem to).            As I already had a 15K Westpac credit card, despite always paying off the balance in full each month, I knew that service-ability would probably be an issue and as such I had my mother come in as well who was happy to do a joint application with me if needed. At the time my full salary was aprox 65K with my mum's at 80K+ however my new role was also going to be at 80K starting in a couple weeks. I would prefer to service the credit card myself but as I explained to the specialist if the application serviceability was in doubt we were happy to do a joint application. In addition I had 25K in savings, 120K in stocks and 26K in crypto currency so the asset side of the application was fine.            We went through the regular profile questions and then everything went wrong.             Firstly the specialist said that my income looked sufficient just on my current payslips to service the credit card application, as I was a new to bank customer he advised that the application would probably be referred to the credit team and that the credit team would contact me in 3-5 business days directly to go through the application in which case he advised that they might ask me to provide my letter of employment, but that the letter should easily be sufficient. As such the application got sent off in my sole name and I waited.            I didn't hear anything back for 6 business days so I sent the specialist Jogi an email touching base with him as to the status of the application as I hadn't heard anything from the ANZ credit team. He still to this day hasn't responded to the email and it's been almost 2 weeks since I sent him the follow up email.            I got sick of waiting when it reached 8 business days with no response from anyone and as you had failed to honour your own timeframe that I was provided I called up the ANZ credit card team to see what the hell was going on. It turned out my application got declined and that nobody bothered to call me in regards to documents, my application status or anything. The person on the phone was very helpful but it was alarming to hear that despite the specialist going through my financial portfolio in the appointment for the profile that he had incorrectly transcribed multiple details across to the application. In any case the person on the phone said that I would be sent a text shortly with an email address that I would be able to forward my financial documents through to (including my letter of employment for a second opinion).

However, I was told that I needed to make an appointment and the next available appointment was over 1.5 hours just to enquire. I would have liked to stay as an ANZ customer, but it was not worth me going home or waiting 1.5 hours to ask one simple question.

Why should a customer make an appointment to make an everyday enquiry? You can see other customers complaining about it with you.

Upon our first visit to our local branch we were served by Nakul Shah. He came across confident but when we pressed him for further information with some questions he said it was above his pay grade and we should go home and look it up on the internet or phone ANZ ourselves. We did this and with some help from our company accountant we went back into the Victoria Point Branch thinking we had it all sorted with the documents the accountant told us to take. After waiting for over 45 minutes, Nakul started to prepare the package we requested and then stopped saying we had the wrong documents and that our accountant had incorrectly registered our company. We didnt agree and even rang our accountant who tried to explain that it was correct and that Nakul should proceed. He refused and said that he had been doing this for 6 months and knew better than our accountant who has been operating for longer than I can recall. He insisted we were wrong and went and got the manager (She did not introduce herself) who agreed with Nakul and they repeatedly told us we were wrong and how we were wrong and that they refused to setup the business package we requested. We agreed to disagree and ended up leaving. We went back to our accountant the next day, clarified the details and they offered to send an accountant with us to the branch to explain it. We decided to go to the Cleveland Branch by ourselves as it is close to the accountant and hope for the best and the accountant would come down if we called for their help.

Firstly, we had accumulated $300,000 which was earmarked for the purchase of a principal residence in the next 2-3 years. We were advised to establish a margin loan of $250,000 and invest the $300k and $250k together in a portfolio of managed funds. After investing for near on 2 years our original $300,000 had produced a loss of $10,938.73 (this is after allowing for the income produced off the portfolio). Had we been invested in a conservative portfolio with no gearing (such as a term deposit), we would have incurred no loss and had the full original capital amount available for a home. Secondly, we were advised to establish a self managed superannuation fund We had not sought such a complex superannuation structure, nor did our circumstances warrant such complexity. Add to that the short-term likelihood of working overseas (becoming a non-resident) which would prevent us from acting as Trustees for our fund and either increasing the fund's management costs or causing its closure, we believe the advice to establish the fund was not in our best interest and more in the interest of the adviser receiving fees for its establishment and ongoing management. PLUS, the accounting fee for our SMSF increased by $6,000 due to the tax reporting offered by the ANZ fund. An additional cost we did not expect or budget for. Thirdly, we believe ANZ did not comply with the Ongoing Service Agreement we signed. A number of services were offered as part of this Agreement which we did not receive.

Thing is, I'd notified ANZ that I would be overseas.      It's also the third time it's happened in the recent past.      I was stranded in the US for several days, unable to access my funds due to ANZ locking the account. While I understand the security reasons behind this, I spent 6 frantic days calling the international hotline trying to find a way to access my money so that I could pay the gap fee for emergency medical treatment (I needed to go to hospital due to lupus while overseas, but couldn't be seen by a doctor because my account was on hold).      Fortunately, I'd arranged an ANZ travel card in US dollars in case of emergency. Smart thinking -- so I thought.      Turns out hardly any businesses in the US would accept the travel card, as it didn't have a name on it. Most importantly, the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM would not accept it as a legitimate form of payment and turned me away.      Over 6 phone calls to ANZ (and a lot of money spent in international charges) I was informed that the only way I could reinstate my phone/internet banking would be if I ran a special virus scan on all my devices back in Australia, or sent them back to the manufacturer for a factory reset. I argued that this way highly abnormal and utterly ridiculous, seeing as I was overseas for work for a fortnight.      I was promised on multiple occasions that my issue was being looked into and that someone would contact me within a few hours. This never happened. Despite 6 calls, not one customer service representative managed to call me back or follow up my stressed situation; stranded overseas with no access to money.

13245,COM-480347,COM-480347_1,incorrect amount charged for restructure of home loan to investment loan,"Several months ago I received an out-of-the-blue phone call from ANZ in which I was advised that I needed to change my home loan account to an investment account, since I was not living in the house any longer. I was told that there would be 'no penalty' associated with the changeover, and that all details would otherwise be the same. I rang back later to arrange this and spent 15 minutes on the phone getting this changed over. I felt that this was a little pointless since the home loan would be fully paid within the next 12 months, but I did it anyway. I was told a couple of times that there would be an $80 fee for the changeover. I thought this was a little excessive for something that involved 'no penalty', but as the person I was speaking to did not seem to understand my questions and I did not want to spend any longer on the phone, I just went with it. I later found, when the money came out of my everyday account, that the fee was not $80 but a rather hefty $200. It is worth noting that this is a loan which has less than 10% of the original loan amount remaining and will be paid in the next 12 months. I also asked if there would be any change to my repayments, and I was told that these would continue to come out as usual. When I later saw that my everyday account balance was higher than normal, however, I saw that my fortnightly loan repayments had not been set up properly as they were previously (payments of $1000/fortnight) but had been reset to the minimum repayment amount ($81/fortnight). I have since rectified this (and it was fortunate that I noticed it) but I did specifically ask about it and was assured that everything was going to continue as normal. So essentially, I received an unsolicited phone call to make an unnecessary change to a soon-to-be-closed account and was charged $200 to make changes that I would then have to go back and correct myself. It has left me with a rather bad taste in my mouth, as I feel that I have complied with a system that the bank has set up and been penalised for doing so.   I would like a refund of the fee, since it was never agreed to -- or at least the $120 difference between the quoted amount and the actual amount. It is also worth considering that the changeover required me to make corrections after the fact, as the repayments were not set up properly as advised.",incorrect amount charged for restructure of home loan to investment loan - refunded $200 due to incorrect information provided,33,"Several months ago I received an out-of-the-blue phone call from ANZ in which I was advised that I needed to change my home loan account to an investment account, since I was not living in the house any longer.

14261,COM-481891,COM-481891_1,Customer is unhappy with Annual Fee increase for ANZ Platinum Card.,"I am writing to you concerning my ANZ Visa Platinum Card. I originally opened this account as a Classic Visa with the rewards program in 1997. My account has run continually under the rewards program for over 20 years without any blemishes to it's record. Every month the balance has cleared for the full amount owing on the closing balance. In 2012, I received a letter from yourselves offering my account to be transferred a ANZ Platinum Visa at no additional cost. I enquired about any additional charges in the future, as it meant closing my excisting cards & new cards issuing. At the time, I possessed a Visa Card & an American Express Card, linked to the same account. In the last year, I received an email to say the American Express Card had been discontinued.       When I received my December Visa statement, I was dismayed to see a annual fee of $240. Since the card was issued to me as a Platinum account, I have been charged an annual fee of $40.00, plus the Rewards Program fee of $55.00. I have a copies of statements from December 2012 to December 2016 which show these charges. If you check my records, you will see this is correct. I enquired with your staff by telephone, & was advised that the fee on my card was charged according the the status of the account ,i.e. a Platinum Visa. I was not impressed with the situation, & informed your staff member the length of time & the manner in which my account has operated for over 20 years. I also stated the comlexity with the procedure to change to the Platinum Cards. The staff member offered to reverse the fees & stated the option to again change my card to a Classic Card.      It was the ANZ's offer in the first place to change to a Platinum Card, with, I might add, no change to the conditions of the card, or any time limit of additional costs. Is the hassle of changing back to a Classic Card the best you have to offer? I think the way you keep track of your correspondence in the first place is completely unprofessional.

He would like to find out what lead to the account going into arrears.,"I would like to sincerely apologise for the poor service and inconvenience caused to you since raising your concerns with ANZ. I?d also like to thank you for the opportunity to investigate your concerns further.  As discussed on 10 January, the $500 deposit you made on 1 December 2017 via the branch was deposited to your savings account ending in ***543 and not to your loan. I understand you still hold the receipt of the deposit made via the branch and this would indicate which account the deposit was made to.  I apologise for any misunderstanding as to which account you requested the funds to be deposited to. I have submitted feedback to the branch to review internally.  To avoid any confusion in the future with your manual deposits made to your loan via your ANZ card, the teller must receive confirmation as to which account you wish the funds to be deposited to, as your savings account ending in ***543 is the primary account linked to the card, not your loan.  I am sorry this was not uncovered sooner and you continued to be concerned about the amount deposited.  As advised, some of your contracted loan repayment amount was deducted from the amount you had in redraw on your loan and only the remaining amount of$105 appeared as the amount behind on the loan. Hence, why you had received collection calls advising you were behind by $105.  Given the inconvenience caused to you, I offered to write-off this balance of $105 and you declined this offer. You advised a fair resolution would be for ANZ to cover the next monthly amount due on your loan.  I have considered this offer to be a fair resolution to resolve your complaint and I am happy to credit your loan with $443.57.  It?s important to note some of the current arrears of $105 will be deducted from the amount I credit to your loan. I would recommend you transfer the $105 from your savings account (where the $500 was deposited to) into your loan to avoid any issue with the next loan repayment.  As discussed, I have enclosed the reconciliation of your loan and I am happy to request an up to date home loan statement to be sent to you once the arrears amount is cleared.

Prior to the first draw down I went to the ANZ branch to process loan application details, including setting up bank accounts.  I did not receive a bank statement for my mortgage account from ANZ until 22/11/17 (103 days).  However, I did have access this whole time to online banking to an ANZ transaction account number ending 9045), which had the remainder of the loan as a positive balance, and into which I had been making regular payments (labelled ""MORTGAGE REPAYMENT"") from another financial institution account. I had thought both this balance and my payments were in my mortgage account and was surprised to find out this wasn't the case on the 22nd.  I contacted ANZ on the 23rd to explain the situation and request that both the balance and my extra repayments be applied to my mortgage account on their respective transaction dates (as I had thought and intended).  This would mean a partial refund of some interest charges on my account. I thought this was a fair request since  1. My mortgage account was not visible online, and nobody from ANZ gave me instructions or a message for over three months that this wasn't the case. (The service agent I first called on the 23/11/17 said the onus was on me to have done this after the loan became active.)  2. My payments were clearly marked ""MORTGAGE REPAYMENT"" and I did not intend to deposit money simply from one transaction account to another.  3. If I had received a statement for my mortgage account or otherwise had access to information on it earlier (e.g. internet banking) I would have transferred the balance and payments from the transaction account into the mortgage account.

In the post I received a letter saying that there was something off in my credit rating file. I requested a copy of this, and there was absolutely nothing in the credit rating report (I have always kept a clean credit history). I then applied for a platinum card, and once again had to submit copious amounts of documentation, before finally getting the card... which ended up being a reward card instead of a Qantas FF card. Finally I gave up and just went into a branch. Here I was told that I just need to request the black Qantas card online which we did in the branch. 3 days later I contacted the agent that helped me, saying I had heard nothing yet. He responded saying that the card would just arrive in the post, but since it was no longer a ""NEW"" application I would not get the Qantas points for the introductory offer.

This was utmost importance as Keith had some very important payments to be made. On the 19th December on one of my many trips to Victoria in the past 2 months I went to the Camperdown(Vic) branch (where Keith has his accounts) and expected it to be a formality to be granted Keiths attorney with his bank. However I learnt from Ray (Camperdown) that it was necessary for the form to be sent to a new section within ANZ. I picked up the necessary paperwork and was informed by Ray that it could be dropped off at any branch. The following day (20th) I dropped it off at the Tarneit (Vic)) branch. I was also informed it would take about 3 working days to process. Considering the Christmas HolidaysI waited until the banks opened after the break and rang Ray at Camperdown to enquire if it had been processed. His reply was no and asked where had I dropped it off. He said he would contact Tarneit and get back to me. He replied soon after and told me the unsent form was still at the Tarneit branch !!! He said he would speed it up to make sure it got to the right section. On Sat 30th December my brother Keith passed away. On Tuesday 2nd January I received a call from ANZ informing the Power of Attorney had been processed. I said dont bother - its to late !!

16724,COM-485718,COM-485718_1,poor service,". Arrogant Manner Customer Service officer-Aiun (about 4pm Fri 3 Feb) terminated my conversation before I had satisfaction because in his opinion he had provided options, leaving me without closure. Poor listener, derogatory tone, interrupter, confrontational, information focused-not a people person. Controlled the conversation without empathy or understanding of the customer's situation over an extended period of non-action from the bank. Didnât want to hear my point of view or frustration as a customer. Shameful and deeply hurtful 2. Closure of accounts Have closed two ANZ accounts because of dissatisfaction. I can provide more details on request & explain why the Teachers Mutual Bank is now my preferred bank, providing exemplary, transparent customer service. 3. Termination of Term Deposit/Request to move it to another bank. 16 Jan 2018, I was directed by your team to open a savings account with you as this was the only way to park this money before I could transfer it to another bank. This was not linked to my online banking as requested until I rang again on 2 Feb. Unsatisfactory. Until then, I could not access it for a personal payment. Unethical. Disgraceful. 4. Non declared Fees. I was told a fee may be attached to the transfer of my money under one of the options to move it. Again, unethical. I was directed by you to open the account in the first place & refuse to pay the non disclosed fee, expecting an exemption.   Outcome sought 1. A personal apology by phone from the person who terminated my conversation. After 40 years with your bank, I deserve better treatment as a customer but more importantly the person needs to take responsibility to resolve the impact of his treatment of others. 2. Please provide feedback to Kanni in customer service. She was an outstanding improvement on the former. A listener, calm, understanding, astute, non-confrontational. Promote her. Analyse her strengths and replicate them in others. 3. A change in your practices to improve transfer/withdrawal of funds to another bank. Unnecessarily convoluted and non-transparent. Another reason Iâm leaving. 4. A genuine phone-call to acknowledge receipt of this complaint and a response to each point raised above.

We strongly believe the decision to scorecard decline the application is deficient. We have been in contact with the assessor since December 2017 and at no stage was there ever any mention of scorecard or scorecard issues with the application or the applicants. As a result the client will not be able to meet the purchase settlement due tomorrow 6th February 2018 and at best will incur penalties and more likely lose the entire deposit, with the strong likelihood that it will adversely impact his real estate business standing in the local community. We are of the strong belief that ANZ has failed in its legal and moral obligations to provide full and clear disclosure of any concerns, changes in policy in a timely manner. If this was done the applicant (an existing ANZ client) would have the opportunity to seek alternative finance options. This lack of concern for this existing ANZ client is hard to understand in view of ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott's' recent comments ( refer https//bluenotes.anz.com/posts/2018/01/Elliott-why-ANZ-backs-the-Royal-Commission). In the circumstances we would appreciate if this matter can be urgently escalated to the highest authority possible, as we fully expect that a formal complaint will be lodged with the Financial Ombudsman to recover any losses incurred.

After we activated card, we filled the direct debit form and faxed out as per instructions on the form. My wife went to burwood branch around 10 days after we faxed form, just to make sure the direct debit has been all setup a couple of days before we went overseas. Staff told her the system was down and just to wait for statement would be fine. Then we went overseas for 2 weeks. Suprisingly I received a reminder text when we were overseas which really upset me. We have done everything we could we filled direct debit form and faxed, we went branch to confirm the status, we asked someone checking mail for us. I donât understand how it happened and that text really ruined my holiday. So we went to Burwood branch today as first thing after we come back to figure out. Staff Elaine (or Ring) served us didnât want to listen to our story, simply telling us âyes, thatâs normal, it happen to me also even I am a staff!â She asked us when and how I faxed form. I explained both of our forms were faxed together but my wifeâs one had gone through. Although she didnât receive statement, her payment has gone through direct debit, She kept rolling her eyes at us when we were trying to explain to her what we have done. She asked us to call credit card team ourself as retail level has no authority to credit card account. Since we insisted her to ring from branch, she did ring for us and ask waive of late payment. At the end she hang up, and said she had make the effort to get the late payment fee waived. If itâs not her call, credit card team wasnât willing to waive!! .....WHAT?!!! I am sorry as a customer firstly why I should pay for this kind of service. I understand she is not at the level but she is not even willing to help customer who is already in the branch. She thought she could make her day goes quicker if she pushed all customer out of the door?! If thatâs the case, i recommend ANZ should close all branch and not waste money on this kind of service. Secondly, as a customer why should I pay fee for error at your end. Let me tell you, the whole time, I didnât receive any apology.

Thirdly, no one in the branch or on the phone could fix the issue.

Perhaps I should tell them I dont read English so well ?        It is very disappointing that despite all the promises initially made and communicated to me that how much coverage and benefit I will receive by going with ANZ Home Content insurance for my new home, only to discover that is not the case and huge discrepancy exist between what is promised and what actually is covered.      It was also very obvious to me that since first day of claim lodgement, ANZ insurance had no intention of reviewing or assessing the case for possible approval, but instead ANZ Insurance were actually in the background gathering information on how we are going to decline this claim       The intention to assist was none existent since day one.  Rather to cover ANZ itself , keep charging the premium ANZ could charge and not pay any claim by pointing out definitions on Oxford Dictionary    .   despite whatever was stated in product disclosure PDF, a set of house key with car keys attached is more than common in any ordinary household.

They have advised me to pretty much sXXk it up and take it to ombudsman , they aint paying no matter what. !! see attached document.      Would you please escalate accordingly through ANZ channel , perhaps even complaint department.  Their reason for decimal is preposterous  and quite hilarious actually that ANZ even went as far as checking Oxford dictionary to emphasize that there is no way ANZ will pay as per dictionary definition.      Perhaps I should tell them I dont read English so well ?        It is very disappointing that despite all the promises initially made and communicated to me that how much coverage and benefit I will receive by going with ANZ Home Content insurance for my new home, only to discover that is not the case and huge discrepancy exist between what is promised and what actually is covered.      It was also very obvious to me that since first day of claim lodgement, ANZ insurance had no intention of reviewing or assessing the case for possible approval, but instead ANZ Insurance were actually in the background gathering information on how we are going to decline this claim       The intention to assist was none existent since day one.  Rather to cover ANZ itself , keep charging the premium ANZ could charge and not pay any claim by pointing out definitions on Oxford Dictionary    .   despite whatever was stated in product disclosure PDF, a set of house key with car keys attached is more than common in any ordinary household.       How can it not fall within items to claim. ?       Please kindly assist in escalating my dissatisfaction to the relevant department within ANZ.  Although the product underwritten by QBE but it is an ANZ product after all and carrying the ANZ brand and purchased at an ANZ Branch, I would like ANZ to provide resolution immediately.Wealth caseWealth case33",0.0,0.0

I have been a client of ANZ and its predessesor since 1948 when E S & A had a Branch in Tarlee SA 5411, and my family have been client/customers since before the E S & A Branch was opened in Tarlee SA in about 1927.  Recently I sold my house in Tarlee having downsized by moving to the above address in Riverton SA on 6 Feb 2017.  On 31 October 2017 I invested $90,000 of the house proceeds in a 12 month Term deposit not believing that I would need access to the money before then - 31 October 2018.  Having being taught many years ago ""not to put all my eggs in one basket"", I invested an identical amount of $90,000 in a 36 month Term Investment with Peoples Choice Credit Union.  However,  unexpectedly my wife (V J Tayler) was admitted as a Long Term Resident of Riverton & District Hospital.  I needed therefore to redeem both amounts of $90,000 to pay as much of the $250,000 Bond needed by the Riverton Hospital.  I was told that some Financial Institutions forego the penalty if anyone needs to withdraw their funds early because of such unexpected and urgent cicumstances.  This I put o both my ANZ Brtanch officer at Riverton and to the Peoples Choice credit Union with whom I had not previously done business.  Peoles Choice immediately said, because of circumstances, they would forego any penalty for early withdrawal, and we received $90,000 plus $605 Interest. However the ANZ Branch Officer at Riverton, when told the same reason said that ANZ are very strict about such withdrawals and after speaking to her superior officer by phone, said that I could access the $90,000 on 12 Feb 2018 but there would be a penalty on the Interest payable.  I subsequently received $90,103.35 today.

Having being taught many years ago ""not to put all my eggs in one basket"", I invested an identical amount of $90,000 in a 36 month Term Investment with Peoples Choice Credit Union.  However,  unexpectedly my wife (V J Tayler) was admitted as a Long Term Resident of Riverton & District Hospital.  I needed therefore to redeem both amounts of $90,000 to pay as much of the $250,000 Bond needed by the Riverton Hospital.  I was told that some Financial Institutions forego the penalty if anyone needs to withdraw their funds early because of such unexpected and urgent cicumstances.  This I put o both my ANZ Brtanch officer at Riverton and to the Peoples Choice credit Union with whom I had not previously done business.  Peoles Choice immediately said, because of circumstances, they would forego any penalty for early withdrawal, and we received $90,000 plus $605 Interest. However the ANZ Branch Officer at Riverton, when told the same reason said that ANZ are very strict about such withdrawals and after speaking to her superior officer by phone, said that I could access the $90,000 on 12 Feb 2018 but there would be a penalty on the Interest payable.  I subsequently received $90,103.35 today.    Obviously when I wish to invest more money or have my ANZ Term Deposit or Progress Saver accounts come due I will reassess my investment strategy!customer not able to get access to his term deposit early even after providing an extenuating circumstance as where the staff at people's choice credit union allowed him to break his term deposit with no penalty due to the same reason he provided ANZ. customer will be re assessing on where he will be investing his money due to this experience. customer has advised it is not a complaint and not a compliment as well more of feedbackcustomer has stated its not a complaint or a compliment just wanted to pass on feedback15",0.0,0.0

I have had and still have a personal loan with your company and a credit card which I have had Aug 2015. I bank with you and have a saver and progress saver account. Also, the company I work for IAG Insurance has multiple accounts with you. On the 31/1/2018 I applied for a fixed rate personal loan 10.99% to consolidate my credit card and variable rate personal loan that I currently have with you and a little extra for an operation and holiday. When I took the personal loan out with you in Jan 2017 I was advised by one of your consultants the variable rate would suit me better. Which now I donât believe that was the best option for me so I decided to consolidate the variable rate personal loan and credit card so I could then close the credit card and have only the fixed rate personal loan. I have had the most unpleasant experience with your company which has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety. On the 5/2/2018 I received an email to advise my fixed personal loan application had been approved and upon my acceptance the funds would be available to me. (email attached) I called your company to only be advised this email was what gets sent automatically which is an outright dishonest statement. I was also told I needed to go to an ANZ Branch to confirm my identity which I did straight away on the 5/2 to the Swanston st branch where I waited for 40 mins only to return back to work and contact ANZ to see if they had a copy of my identity which they advised they did not and that I needed to return to the branch and show my identity again which I did to the Bourke st branch where I waited another 40mins. I also had to scan other documents to you for my identity. This was never an issue when I got the credit card in 2015 and the personal loan in 2017.

We were unable to do this as my husband does not have a bank card and has not set up on GoMoney app. Anyway there was a misunderstanding between customer service teller Tommy and I, as I was not clear how we could link the 2 accounts. He was unsure also, and asked for assistance from other staff. He asked why I was trying to set it up (with my husband present next to me), I explained that my husband is not tech savvy, and only uses his phone for calls or text and I usually deal with our finance accounts. We had to order a new debit card for my husband so as to link account etc...I was trying to explain to the Tommy that our account was a joint account and could we try and link the business account to ours, so that we can check balance only for the business. He did explain the process, which i now understand - I felt like he didn't really take the time to listen to me and felt he was quite cocky in his responses. I admit, that my responses to him was very direct in my frustration. Anyway, we ordered a new card for my husband. Tommy then asked for my card and entered something on his keyboard. We left the counter a little upset. I didn't want to deal with Tommy any longer, so I walked over to the smart atm inside bank to deposit money, only to find out that my card was locked? I then walked up to another counter and asked another bank teller if I could deposit money using my debit card. She also advised me that I could no longer use my card...I asked since when, as I used it the day before...I said to her that I believe that guy there (Pointing at Tommy) locked or cancelled my card...I believe he cancelled/locked to get back at me for my direct responses towards him. Bank teller continued to say she was not sure why? I said to her, that's because he (Tommy) locked my card. She did not respond. But I firmly believe Tommy cancelled my card on purpose!! Bank teller then reordered another card for me..So thanks to Tommy, I have no card for a week or so. My work hours do not match bank opening hours, which means limited cash this week.

Please note I was working overseas from January 2017 until October 2017 and hence unable to attend to this notification at the time. The letter refers to a closed credit card account where you state that from August 5, 2017 you would be raising the fee by $200 which is *500% And as this account is closed why should I have to pay a rewards program service fee of $55. I do not receive any services to be charged for.* This is totally unacceptable and no reflection at all on the costs associated with this account. Since July 2012 the balance on this account was $27,500, Since then until June 2017 I have made $32,000 in payments. You have collected just on $20,000 in interest and charges of these charges you have received $ 640 in late payment fees. This equates to 32 months out of 60 that I have been unable to afford to pay this debt on time. *These late payment fees are well in excess of other financial institutions and your due dates vary from month to month.* Other institutions also send reminders via email and phone SMS to help me avoid these fees. Your institution only provides persistent harassing phone calls after the late fees has been applied. Clearly I am struggling to pay this debt currently, let alone with further increased costs. I am having severe difficulty meeting the current obligations. Your statements show that it could take over 70 years to pay this account. Y*ou refuse to lower my credit limit* meaning I am unable to refinance this through another institution. I have made several requests for this both online, over the phone and in January I visited the Bankstown Branch and was told no-one was available for over an hour to attend to my request, subsequently I was advised to make this request via your feedback form online. Initially before taking this complaint further, I require this account to - * be transferred to the lowest rate and fee credit card (first card $30 annual fee, 19.74 %) * Refund the extra $210 charged on 17/9/2017 * Lower the credit limit to the current outstanding balance Currently I am reviewing the fees paid to date since this card was closed as I believe there is a case of substantial overcharging of unfair fees since that date.

I was also advised by the manager to not make any transfer till the last loan fund has been cleared and no interest will be charged till then. On 31/1 the remaining fund of 43,000 was finally deposited into my account. I then proceeded to transfer the funds into relevant offset accounts on 5/2/18. My query today would be in regards to Residential Investment Property loan $160,000 acc 013377 681730251 where $235.79 interest was charged which amount to more than 5 days of interest. Could you please clarify how was the interest calculated?

Subsequent to this payment executing the online system initiated a another payment duplicating the manual payment. As one of the payments was a staff termination payment I contacted ANZ on the 13th to ask for the payment to be cancelled. I was advised that this could not be done and that ANZ would need to contact the recipient to seek return of the funds. At this time I was given no indication of time-frame. I contacted ANZ again on/around the 20th and was then advised that I would be contacted in the next couple of days about the outcome. After no further contact I again called ANZ and was this time advised that it would take up to 30 days as it was a bank error (apparently a customer error would have been 45 days). I contacted you again on the 19th and was told someone would get back to me. I then received an email today with an attachment indicating it was the result of my inquiry. Unfortunately the attachment was password protected and I couldn't open it so I called again. This time I was told that the funds could not be recovered and that I had to raise a complaint if I was not happy with the out come - so here's the complaint.

22149,COM-494367,COM-494367_1,Payment Reversal not actioned,"To whom it may concern. On Tuesday the 6th of March at approximately 6pm I rushed home, after travelling for 7hrs in a unexpected road trip in a hire truck, and got onto my ANZ app to fix my credit card up as I knew I'd overdrawn it. My partner thought he transfered $600 to my credit card that morning, but it was one of my online saver accounts. I didn't stop and look and transfered $500 from the account with enough money to cover it. As soon as I'd done it I realised it was my fathers account I'd transfered it from and the money my partner transfered hadn't been  put into my account yet. I was also expecting my pay from work later that night. I did not have the $500 to transfer it straight back and I checked constantly for ages, then waited until  after 7 and tried again, my partners money was in so I put another $500 in the credit card to transfer back to my fathers account. When I went to pick his account it was not there. My brother has power of attorney and never got my parent's account unlinked from mine, I left it on there so I could not shop at the places he shopped. He had obviously seen $500 missing in the hour I was waiting for money to come into my accounts and got my account unlinked from my father's account immediately. I rang ANZ approx 730pm to get the payment reversed and was told I would have to go into my branch and sort it out. I could not go to my branch the next day as I had to babysit my 4 month old grandson for the first time in Parramatta and I left home early so I could go to Parramatta Westfield ANZ just in case they could do something, the concierge told me because it was a transfer between accounts I had access to, nothing could be done. First thing Thursday 8th I went to Sutherland ANZ, my branch, and was told at the information desk that it could not be reversed now that the accounts aren't linked. The only solution other than keeping it (both ladies in both branches suggested that) or handing it back in person was to send a bank cheque registered mail then I would have proof it was received.  So I went to the teller payed $510 to get a $500 bank cheque from me to my father. Then paid another $7.95 at the post office for the registered reply envelope. Yesterday Tuesday 13th of March I received the signed card from the registered bank cheque so I know my  brother received it. Tonight I noticed on my ANZ app that on Monday 12th March $500 had been reversed from my credit card. This means I am now $500 out of pocket because the ANZ reversed a payment that I got told 3 times could not be reveresed. I cannot talk to my brother about this, I am a victim of his physical and mental abuse and I do everything I can to avoid him. This whole mistake I made with the tap of a finger has caused me 3 weeks of breakdowns and stress. I had to send him my address to get confirmation he'd received the cheque, since then I've been in lockdown at home and I won't leave home alone. I went to Sutherland ANZ Tuesday 20th March to see if the cheque had been cashed and he'd deposited it Monday the same day the reversal took place. Obviously he knew the reversal was taking place as he must have made someone do it. I cannot get my money back off him without endangering myself, so I implore you to do the right thing and correct the error you made happen with your  obviously incorrect advice. I cannot understand how you could not put somenone else's money back into their account for me yet you can take my money without asking and give it back to the person it belongs to, it's the same thing but this cost me my privacy and an extra $517.95. $500 is one weeks pay. I cannot afford to be $500 short.

24291,COM-497860,COM-497860_1,Replacement card,"Hi, My Visa debit card associated with my access account expired in February. As no date was listed on the card, only the month, I went into the Casuarina NT branch in mid January to ensure that a replacement had been ordered and would arrive prior to the expiration date. An employee in the branch explained to me that the cards expired at the end of the month listed, and that replacements were automatically mailed out two weeks prior to this. I work away, and was away the last week of February, fully expecting that my replacement card would be waiting in my mailbox when I returned home. When it wasn't, I went into the Darwin city branch on the 2nd of March and ordered a new one, and withdrew enough cash for the weekend. When I still hadn't received the card by the 16th of March, I ordered a new one from the Casuarina branch whilst making a withdrawal. The very next day Darwin was struck by Tropical Cyclone Marcus, causing extensive damage and affecting essential services. When I still hadn't received a card by early April I assumed that it was due to the resultant delays to the postal service. On Monday the 9th of April, I called ANZ for what would be at least the third time regarding this matter, and the operator was eventually able to determine the fault; despite my addressÂ  being correct in the system, there was ""another address in the back end of the system"" that my cards were being posted to. This was despite my double checking every time I followed up on this matter, that my card was being posted to my correct address- at least three times over the phone and four times whilst visiting branches to make withdrawals. I have found this experience incredibly frustrating and inconvenient. During what was a difficult time due to the cyclone, I did not have ready access to my own money, and would have to make frequent trips into branches, often with my small children in tow, in order to make withdrawals, as well as depend on the funds of my partner when unanticipated expenses arouse outside of business hours. I have been a loyal ANZ customer for at least fourteen years, and have even recommended the bank to friends for its service and dependability, but this whole experience has left me on the verge of closing down all my accounts and banking elsewhere, which may yet still happen if I'm subjected to further delays in receipt of a card. For one of the biggest banks in Australia to struggle with something so basic simply isn't good enough.

24412,COM-498095,COM-498095_1,Account Closure,"Good Riddance to Bad Banking! I am an expat living in Switzerland and an ANZ account holder. After 4 years I decided to cancel my ANZ accounts, as I do not use them and I did not want to pay fees anymore. I had asked previously if fees could be frozen until I returned, but told no, it was not possible. As this was my first bank account, I was reluctant to make this decision. Last March (2017) I was in Australia and visited an ANZ branch in Colins Street to cancel my accounts. I had changed my address in the meantime, and the ANZ Personal Banker asked me for my new address. As it is an overseas address, he attempted to enter it, but for some reason he could not do it. He advised me to call phone banking to do it, as he could not help. This was after 45 minutes. I then contacted ANZ phone banking several months later, and because of the time difference, the department that could complete this closure was closed. I then waited until the time had changed (winter time) as I did not want to wake up at 4am in the morning just to reach this department. I first closed my credit card account, and by the time they had completed that, the other department that could help me with my regular accounts was closed. This was after about 30 minutes at an international rate from Switzerland to Australia. I then rang some time later again to cancel my regular accounts. After a long time holding, I attempted to close the account, but as there was still a balance of AUD 65.00, I was advised it was not possible until the account was AUD 0.00. I don't have internet banking, nor other Australian accounts, so my options were limited. I was never issued a new card for the account, so I could not use this to deduct the funds. I asked for a cheque to be sent, but was told this was not an option. Why? A bank cannot issue a bank cheque to a customer of nearly 25 years? I asked to speak to someone else, and was then told after a long time on hold, that the money could be transferred via an international transfer, which had to be done by another department. After that, the account could be closed. Once transferred, I was advised that the transfer would cost AUD 12.00. What? Why? I complained it about and asked it to be waived, but was told there was nothing that could be done about it. After giving my foreign bank details, I was put onto three automated terms and conditions that I had to agree to. After the third, the line just disconnected. This was after 40 minutes on the phone at international rates. I rang back (annoyed of course), was put through to the normal help desk and had to reexplain the situation. She then put me through to foreign payments, where I was again greeted with the voice recording and had to make my way back to a 'personal banker'. I then had to reexplain the situation, to which she said I had to listen to the terms and conditions again (this is about 10 minutes long). I advised that I had already heard them, and did not wish to hear them again as it was expensive call. After some hesitation, she finalised the transfer and put me back through to the account closures department, to which I had to reexplain the situation again. He told me the account could not be closed as there were still funds in the account. After explaining the situation, he told me that it would be forwarded to another department, and if the funds were AUD 0.00 after five business days, the account would be closed. I asked if I would be contacted if there was an issue, and, for whatever reason the account could not be closed and he said no. I would receive a letter within 10 days to confirm only if the account had been closed. Note that I am an international resident and I don't receive most letters, as they are only postage paid Australia. Overall this is extremely poor service.

Lodgement 1454270949 Receipt 346070 My son is getting married in Bali in November & I am paying for the wedding villa. The Villa emailed me an invoice with their bank details to transfer the funds. This was $566USD. I went into the ANZ online service to do the transfer. I have never done this before & it was a little daunting. However, I thought I understood most of it. Firstly, I would like to say that your conversion rate from aud to usd was much higher than the rate calculated online. But I needed to do this so went ahead. I did quickly scan the terms & conditions. But didnt think there was any issue that I could understand. I proceeded with the transfer of $566USD for which you took $764.14 + $12 fee from my account. 3 days later I received an email from the Villa stating they only received $536usd & I needed to pay the balance of $30usd. I emailed them back stating that was incorrect & attached a copy of my Transfer Lodgement Receipt. A subsequent email from them attaching their bank details showing the amount of only $536 received. So, I rang anz customer service to check this. I was told my transfer of 566usd was correct. She (customer representative) suggested perhaps the Villa's bank had taken a ""receiving fee"" which sometimes can happen. Another email to the Villa asking if this was the case as it was an extremely high fee (in aud - especially at anz's rates!) and they did not state on their invoice this would occur. They have today advised me that their bank only charged me $5 receiving fee & my bank (yes, you, ANZ) may have used a ""correspondent bank"" for the transfer who have charged a high receiving fee. (They also said this has only ever happened 3 times in the 5 years they have been operating!) I am very disappointed with ANZ over this entire matter for the following reasons 1. I felt your exchange rate was quite high 2. Your terms & conditions are long winded & not fully explained - i.e why might it be necessary to use a correspondent bank (I supplied all the necessary bank account details for the transfer) 3. At no time before proceeding with the transfer was I informed that a correspondent bank would be used in this instance & how much I would be charged for that thus giving me the opportunity to cancel the transfer & seek an alternative option. This point angers me the most! 4. Why did the anz customer representative not tell me this was the case when I phoned about the discrepancy? She merely stated that ""maybe the recipients bank had taken a receiving fee as this happens sometimes"". No mention of a correspondent bank being used by anz! I am embarrassed about blaming the Villa for taking such a high fee when in fact they only deducted $5usd which, as a gesture of goodwill, they have reversed. So disappointed & frustrated am I over this matter that my immediate thought was to close my accounts with anz. Not that my little pittance would make a difference to you. But unfortunately I have a credit card debt with you & on researching ""balance transfer requests"" online, it seems that anz will not accept balance transfer requests & my only option would be to pay out my balance completely - something I'm not in a position to do - especially with wedding arrangements under way.

We did not receive any written confirmation of any interest rate amount until 5 business days before settlement, when we were advised, that the interest rate would actually be 4.7%. The first written confirmation of the interest rate was received two days before planned settlement. This was very late to tell us. We did not have time to find another bank. I believe this information was deliberately withheld until it was too late for us to change our mind. I believe we were deliberately mislead. We complained to ANZ and on 12/4/18. I received a phone call from Sonia at the complaints team to advise that in order, to rectify the error, that our interest rate would be reduced to 4%.

He had contacted them a day or so later to let them know that they hadn't received the funds and that's when it was discovered there was a hacker in the midst of the transfer. In the meantime the hacker tried to amend another invoice sent. However, luckily they alerted the ANZ customer of the scam before they had paid it.   We notified ACORN on the day we discovered this (29/03/2018) and received a reference number ARN-YK36-BYXP.   We also physically drove to our local NAB, and called the SA police branches close to the hackers receiving bank and made multiple phone calls to ANZ and NAB- where everyone either claims privacy as the reason they cannot assist or just passing the buck back to the other bank saying any requests need to come through them.

He had contacted them a day or so later to let them know that they hadn't received the funds and that's when it was discovered there was a hacker in the midst of the transfer. In the meantime the hacker tried to amend another invoice sent. However, luckily they alerted the ANZ customer of the scam before they had paid it.   We notified ACORN on the day we discovered this (29/03/2018) and received a reference number ARN-YK36-BYXP.   We also physically drove to our local NAB, and called the SA police branches close to the hackers receiving bank and made multiple phone calls to ANZ and NAB- where everyone either claims privacy as the reason they cannot assist or just passing the buck back to the other bank saying any requests need to come through them.  We now have complaints with both ANZ and NAB neither of whom have followed up.  They feel had NAB or ANZ acted quickly, they would have been able to stop the funds being moved   Jake Berghofer & Emma Patterson Eulo & Kingaroy M 0418 649 666   Outcome sought $5500 returned to ANZ Customer (McSweeney) so they can pay us.Fraud transaction dispute - non-customer is unhappy with the timeframes applied to cyber crime cases and the inconvenience caused to those involved as a resultI acknowledge your dissatisfaction with the timeframe it takes to look into Cyber Crime Analysis with ANZ.

Incorrect deduction results in an Access Account overdraw of $6154.43. 	24 April  I call Phone Banking and am transferred through to a customer service assistant. I advise that Card Pay Direct had deducted the Full Closing Balance of my Credit Card from Access Account, contrary to my payment instructions of Minimum Monthly Balance and I request a reversal of the payment. The customer service assistant advises that the reversal will take 24-48 hours to process and subsequently reflect in the accounts.

After the customer service assistant phone Credit Cards, Im advised that the reversal would be processed and backdated to 26 April so that no Overlimit Fee would apply and no interest would accrue on the $6164.43 Dishonour Fee transaction 	28 April  I check Internet Banking to see if the reversal has been processed. Credit Card balance still overdrawn and the card is still suspended due to the banks error. 	28 April  I attend Karrinyup Branch to enquire about the Auto Payment Dishonour Fee reversal as I require the Credit Card for a series of upcoming transactions. Im advised there are no system notes for my visit to the Cloverdale Branch and no sign of any reversal of the Auto Payment Dishonour Fee.

Incorrect deduction results in an Access Account overdraw of $6154.43. 	24 April  I call Phone Banking and am transferred through to a customer service assistant. I advise that Card Pay Direct had deducted the Full Closing Balance of my Credit Card from Access Account, contrary to my payment instructions of Minimum Monthly Balance and I request a reversal of the payment. The customer service assistant advises that the reversal will take 24-48 hours to process and subsequently reflect in the accounts.

After the customer service assistant phone Credit Cards, Im advised that the reversal would be processed and backdated to 26 April so that no Overlimit Fee would apply and no interest would accrue on the $6164.43 Dishonour Fee transaction 	28 April  I check Internet Banking to see if the reversal has been processed. Credit Card balance still overdrawn and the card is still suspended due to the banks error. 	28 April  I attend Karrinyup Branch to enquire about the Auto Payment Dishonour Fee reversal as I require the Credit Card for a series of upcoming transactions.

I was called in and I told the person who was serving me that I wanted to open a transaction account, he set up phone and internet banking for me. At the end when I opened my phone banking I realised he had also opened a savings account. He said they came together. I asked if I could only have the transaction account and he said yes so I asked him to close the savings account he had opened with out my permission.  Shouldnt he ask me before opening any account in my name? I was not given any brochures/information regarding any of the accounts he opened.   Also, I hope in the future when and if I decide to bring my money over to ANZ Bank the fact that I had a savings account does not affect me in getting the introductory bonus rate for a new savings account as I did not get any benefit from the savings account he opened.

We have built 3 owner builder houses, had several investment properties and never missed a payment. Recently we went in to our local Mt Gambier Anz to apply for a owner builder loan. We had started build and had already spent $300k. We had an appointment with loans officer and Manager Matt Foreman. Matt said hello when I got there and then left. I thought he couldnât be bothered. Then our experience with Anz went downhill. We were told we do not take into account your history with Anz. We do not take into account the money you have spent. We can lend on land value only. I asked loan officer was there anything they could do and she e mailed manager and he said maybe a guarantor. I understand the problem Anz has had with owner builders but this is our 5th one, 3 previous with Anz. I felt like Anz was not interested in me as a customer because of owner builder. This time has been very stressful for us. I realise you are in the money making business but you are hurting real people who were loyal to you. We have now secured finance with another lender and have a valuation done of $600k We wanted $250k My wages were good. You have now lost a customer who could be paying interest and who was a very safe bet. In time we will close our accounts and remove all our insurance that we have. I get it that we are only one customer and you are making huge profits. I really donât think you will care that we have been stressed. Maybe if you treat enough customers like this they will leave your bank and you might rethink your values. Obviously our loyalty and history means nothing to you. Thanks for reading this. Maybe pass on to CEO. Thank you. One very disappointed Anz customer. Michael Ralph. 0428 818679",Drafted and apology email and sent to the customer today acknowledging the poor experience he has had. Email sent and copy attached to file.,33,"Owner builder loan. Hello Anz. My wife and I have been loyal customers for 25 years.

This loan has just converted, after twelve months, from interest only to principal and interest. The following is our response at this stage as we are not sure what we should do.    I had previously spoken to our business banker regarding having this re-negotiated to interest only for a longer period as our accountant felt that we needed more time to establish our business cash flow. The business banker agreed that it was a good idea and just asked that we make one full principal and interest payment while he sorted this out to be interest only from the next payment. We did this and heard nothing more despite trying to be in touch. As he knew our financial situation we trusted that we would have support and with no word continued to pay interest only thinking it was being finalised. We would like to know why this hasn?t progressed as discussed and why we have heard nothing till now.    Whilst we enjoy banking with ANZ, we are a little disappointed with the support that we have received. I organised a meeting with our business banker, so he could visit our premises and provide insight into how the bank could help us to grow. He mentioned stock turn loans and international trade assistance, and someone was to be in touch, but this never happened. With the benefit of interim finance to purchase stock we would be in a much better position, so it would have been of benefit to know we could get this assistance before the event. Even when we required help with cash flow over the Christmas period, we were unable to contact our business banker as he was on leave and had to follow up ourselves to find some assistance then at the last minute when we hadn?t heard back from him. It is very disappointing as the ANZ advertises itself as being a champion amongst small business.    We have been in constant contact with our business banker to keep him up to date with our activities in the business and we?re disappointed that the relationship has been so one sided. We have been trying to demonstrate to him that we have been working with our accountant to re-structure, reduce costs and move the business in a more profitable direction.

28844,COM-511266,COM-511266_1,fee charged due to payment not made in correct cycle,"My name is Julie Whiteford and I have held an ANZ Bankcard (now closed, of course, as the Bankcard program is) for a very long time - I think for around 34 years.  Each month, I pay the minimum amount owed on the card and sometimes a bit more and although I've missed the odd beat over the years, I am a very consistent payer of this account.  I always make my payment via (phone) BPay and on 8th January, I made a $25 minimum payment for the month of January - and on 2nd February, I made a $25 minimum payment for the month of February.  What I didn't realise at the time of making the February payment was that I had made it just before the January statement had rolled. I received an SMS in late February, telling me that I hadn't made my February payment. I knew I had made this payment and went back to the January statement for the phone number to contact ANZ about this, as no phone number was provided on the SMS.  In turning the January statement over and seeing my February payment for 2nd February but inside the January statement period, I could immediately see what had happened.  Anyhow, the last thing that I thought was going to be difficult was actually being about to speak with someone. The matter itself remains unresolved, but the first thing to say is that I was disconnected 4 times on the 132273 number when I rang ANZ on the morning of Thursday 1st March.   This happened twice in initially attempting to direct myself to the right area and then when I finally had the opportunity to speak with someone, after simply speaking Operator into the phone, the lady I spoke with said she needed to transfer me to Credit Card Solutions (I think) and asked me to hold on and as soon as she attempted to transfer me, I was disconnected again! I rang up one more time and was disconnected once more, before being able to speak with anyone.  I was obviously frustrated at this point, but also needed to get to work - this all chewed about 20 minutes of time.  Later that day, I then went into the ANZ branch at Broadway in NSW, realising the only way I was going to be helped was at a branch whilst knowing that my enquiry was not something you would normally attempt to resolve at a branch, because it's a phone based team who would normally deal with this.  When I arrived at the Broadway branch, I was there more than 30 minutes before I was served - there were 5 or 6 people waiting to be served ahead of me and although some of them were undoubtedly there for branch based enquiries, some may well have been there for matters they couldn't resolve over the phone.  I am sorry to say, but you have a real problem here. Your phone related issues extend way beyond a situation where people have to wait for some time, but once served (over the phone) can have their matter dealt with. There is a real breakdown in your phone system which is undoubtedly putting pressure on your branches, but must really be frustrating your customers.  When it was finally my turn at ANZ, Broadway, I was served by a truly lovely person, Elina who really wanted to help me. She immediately understood the situation and contacted the appropriate credit card team - the same team the lady in the call centre had been attempting to transfer me to earlier in the day, I thnk.  Elina got onto someone in this team and suggested they speak with me, feeling (I think) that I would explain the situation well, but this person did not want to speak with me and also told Elina that there was nothing they could do to reverse the payment out of the last statement period and prevent me from receiving a missed payment charge, even though the payment was indeed made in February!  I certainly get why the payment got rolled into the last statement period and from now on, I'll ensure I don't make a monthly payment before the 6th day of any month. I am unconcerned with the fact this happened and realise this isn't ANZ's fault, but am very unimpressed with the outcome being that nothing could be done. I thoug",$250.00 goodwill gesture to cover late payment fees and experience.,33,"My name is Julie Whiteford and I have held an ANZ Bankcard (now closed, of course, as the Bankcard program is) for a very long time - I think for around 34 years.  Each month, I pay the minimum amount owed on the card and sometimes a bit more and although I've missed the odd beat over the years, I am a very consistent payer of this account.  I always make my payment via (phone) BPay and on 8th January, I made a $25 minimum payment for the month of January - and on 2nd February, I made a $25 minimum payment for the month of February.  What I didn't realise at the time of making the February payment was that I had made it just before the January statement had rolled. I received an SMS in late February, telling me that I hadn't made my February payment. I knew I had made this payment and went back to the January statement for the phone number to contact ANZ about this, as no phone number was provided on the SMS.  In turning the January statement over and seeing my February payment for 2nd February but inside the January statement period, I could immediately see what had happened.  Anyhow, the last thing that I thought was going to be difficult was actually being about to speak with someone. The matter itself remains unresolved, but the first thing to say is that I was disconnected 4 times on the 132273 number when I rang ANZ on the morning of Thursday 1st March.   This happened twice in initially attempting to direct myself to the right area and then when I finally had the opportunity to speak with someone, after simply speaking Operator into the phone, the lady I spoke with said she needed to transfer me to Credit Card Solutions (I think) and asked me to hold on and as soon as she attempted to transfer me, I was disconnected again! I rang up one more time and was disconnected once more, before being able to speak with anyone.  I was obviously frustrated at this point, but also needed to get to work - this all chewed about 20 minutes of time.  Later that day, I then went into the ANZ branch at Broadway in NSW, realising the only way I was going to be helped was at a branch whilst knowing that my enquiry was not something you would normally attempt to resolve at a branch, because it's a phone based team who would normally deal with this.  When I arrived at the Broadway branch, I was there more than 30 minutes before I was served - there were 5 or 6 people waiting to be served ahead of me and although some of them were undoubtedly there for branch based enquiries, some may well have been there for matters they couldn't resolve over the phone.  I am sorry to say, but you have a real problem here. Your phone related issues extend way beyond a situation where people have to wait for some time, but once served (over the phone) can have their matter dealt with. There is a real breakdown in your phone system which is undoubtedly putting pressure on your branches, but must really be frustrating your customers.  When it was finally my turn at ANZ, Broadway, I was served by a truly lovely person, Elina who really wanted to help me.

29061,COM-511667,,,"Dear ANZ Complaint Resolution Centre On 7 June 2018 you sent me a mail message through my ANZ online banking regarding my transaction disputes. You state that you have recently contacted me and requested that I provide further information etc. You also mentioned you have closed the case etc. Previously you also advised that you had closed the case. At that time I then rang ANZ (i do not recall the date but i think it was April/May 2018) and said that the case is not closed and I will be forwarding additional information to you. I consider the method of contacting me via mail in my ANZ online Account to not be an appropriate and affective method of trying to contact me. It relies on me logging onto ANZ online banking and checking the mail. I consider phone calls direct to me or through my email address RMCOOREY@ADAM.COM.AU to be more effective. At one point when I did try to provide additional information to you via your online dispute portal i found that it was cumbersome and I was unable to tell a story as to why i was lodging the dispute. i then requested on the online portal to be contacted direct via phone or email. I heard nothing back. The Story i wish to tell is further below this email where i have written this on an email to myself dated 15 May 2018. I trust this assists you in your investigation and I look forward to hearing from you. The licensed premised in question have no doubt scammed other people like myself.

You state that you have recently contacted me and requested that I provide further information etc. You also mentioned you have closed the case etc. Previously you also advised that you had closed the case. At that time I then rang ANZ (i do not recall the date but i think it was April/May 2018) and said that the case is not closed and I will be forwarding additional information to you. I consider the method of contacting me via mail in my ANZ online Account to not be an appropriate and affective method of trying to contact me. It relies on me logging onto ANZ online banking and checking the mail. I consider phone calls direct to me or through my email address RMCOOREY@ADAM.COM.AU to be more effective. At one point when I did try to provide additional information to you via your online dispute portal i found that it was cumbersome and I was unable to tell a story as to why i was lodging the dispute. i then requested on the online portal to be contacted direct via phone or email. I heard nothing back. The Story i wish to tell is further below this email where i have written this on an email to myself dated 15 May 2018. I trust this assists you in your investigation and I look forward to hearing from you. The licensed premised in question have no doubt scammed other people like myself.

I met with her Bethany on the 21/06/2018 at witch she has said that the i will get approval for the amount of this loan with the deposit i will provide and that my credit check came in all clear but that unfortunately the ANZ does not do these types of loans as progress payments and will only do the loan once nuilding is completed. this unfortunately does meet the requirements under the contract which will leave me in a position where the builder will cancel my building contract and charge a extra 50-70 thousand dollars to build under a new contract at today's rates. Nitasha and the ANZ have had a copy of this contract for many many months and have known all along what loan is required and Nitasha has been saying all is being progressed and will be fine until now. I am now in a position to suffer great losses and am experiencing great stress as a result of all this.declined application and financial impact to customer15",0.0,0.0

29743,COM-512931,COM-512931_2,Customer angry for disapproval of home loan application.,"Complaint about home loan service Customer name Sharad Bista CRN 774889369 Home loan account numbers 681916873 and 681916881 (Now closed due to refinancing to another bank) Dealing branch Chatswood, NSW Dealing bank agent Ella Wu On 10th January 2018 I went to ANZs Chatswood branch to discuss about borrowing a new home and construction loan and refinancing a house from Bankwest. As I had already resigned from the existing job at that time and was in process of getting a new job, I wanted make sure if ANZ would have issue in lending me the loan. Below is the chronological history of what happened during the loan application process; 1.	During that first conversation on 10th January, I made these things very clear to the agent  I was leaving the existing job on 16th January 2018 then was going for an overseas holiday on 20th January. I was in contact with another employer and expected to start a new job between third week of February and First week of March 2018 (i.e, I would have up to 6 weeks of employment break). I also informed that I would most probably get a new employment contract signed before Australia day. During the overseas holiday I would be unemployed for up to 6 weeks even if I would have new employment contract in place.  2.	At that time the agent advised that she would lend me the land loan based on the existing employment because there was still 6 days left for the termination of that job. She also confirmed that the change in the employment as described in Item 1 above would not be a problem to get the construction loan at later stage as long as I provided the new employment contract and one pay slip, which I submitted as I received. At that time, I was not informed that there was a limitation on the length of employment break for my construction loan to be approved.  3.       I went for the overseas holiday on 20th January. I started the loan application process from there. 4.       As expected, I signed the new employment contract on 22 January. On 24th January, during an overseas phone call with the agent, I informed that to her and also advised the new job starting contractual date of 1st March 2018.

Solicitor fee & charges $1200 cash c.

The land was settled on 22nd February. 7.	From 25th February onward, I started to liaise with the agent for getting pre-approval of the construction loan. I had already got a building quote from the builder which I forwarded to the agent. By that time onwards, the agent had been asking me for a number of documents and information related to my employment. As I understood with her emails that the situation was getting complex due to my employment break of more than 28 days. I provided all requested documents and information promptly. 8.	On March 21 , the agent wrote me an email stating "".....Also, the assessor said he has to refer your application to his boss as there is a gap of more than 28 days which is outside of our policy..."". This was surprising for me as this ""outside of policy"" thing was never brought to my knowledge till that date. In contrary, the agent had been writing me that I had a strong position to get the construction loan.

As I had already resigned from the existing job at that time and was in process of getting a new job, I wanted make sure if ANZ would have issue in lending me the loan. Below is the chronological history of what happened during the loan application process; 1.	During that first conversation on 10th January, I made these things very clear to the agent  I was leaving the existing job on 16th January 2018 then was going for an overseas holiday on 20th January. I was in contact with another employer and expected to start a new job between third week of February and First week of March 2018 (i.e, I would have up to 6 weeks of employment break). I also informed that I would most probably get a new employment contract signed before Australia day. During the overseas holiday I would be unemployed for up to 6 weeks even if I would have new employment contract in place.  2.	At that time the agent advised that she would lend me the land loan based on the existing employment because there was still 6 days left for the termination of that job.

Because of this I am entitled to a $55 refund. I was told on the 5th of July this would take 3-5 business days (it might have been 5-8 working days). Either way this time has come and passed. So I called to find out when this would be refunded. To be told it would take 3 MONTHS to receive this refund.   This is ludicrous considering todays technology. Please understand I have no money. At the end of each pay cycle I had $1.14 in my ING bank account and the ANZ had just enough to cover my mortgage payment. Now I'm being told, with no explanation as to why, that a bank worth millions of dollars is going to withhold my money for 3 months. Why is that the case in today's modern world when refunds take a push of a button? I cannot afford to pay this and then get a refund later. I cannot afford to pay interest for two months while this sits on my credit card.    Your consultant has agreed to waive any interest earned on the first month which i appreciate. And to call back next month to waive again if you still haven't returned the money. Again I appreciate this.      But I want to know why you cannot just push a button and refund money which belongs to me?

We have considered all the information as provided by you and known to ANZ.  Firstly, I would like to provide you with further information regarding the change ANZ recently made in response to the change in cards payment regulations by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).  The RBA regulates interchange fees on credit cards. These interchange fees are paid by the retailer?s bank on every transaction made using a credit card and are set by American Express/Visa/MasterCard.

This RBA change is designed to make the cost of credit cards clearer to users.   However, reward programs are particularly impacted by this change as they have higher costs which are often offset by interchange fees. In order to respond to these changes, ANZ has made a business decision to remove all ANZ American Express cards.    These cards payment industry changes impacts all credit card issuers and ANZ is the first to inform customers of changes to their reward cards as we want to give our customers as much notice as possible.

I rang ANZ and was told very clearly that the charges would be $160 + $160 = $320 for processing the closure of the 3 loans in total (not each loan).  FYI this is not the fee for LTO (as you suspected it was, and requested your contact to check that this charge had not been omitted) as this was paid by Westpac ($157 mortgage registration and $157 discharge registration for each loan) and charged to me by Westpac.  Therefore I was very surprised when part of the $3000 was eventually returned to me via Westpac minus $320 and $320 = $640.  I queried this with Westpac but they can only advise that is what ANZ deducted.  ANZ did not show the receipt of this $3000 from my savings on any of the 3 loan statements ? the statements only show the loan payout amounts.  I called into the Kurralta Park branch last week and ANZ staff spent an hour on the phone to someone trying to get information without any success ? he was promised a letter of explanation but this had not arrived.  Yesterday I used your feedback option on the internet to request an email address to direct my enquiry to but no response has been received today ? I could not locate any other contact email provided for loan or complaint enquiries.  You have kept $640 of my money without accounting for it on my statements and you have not sent any letter regarding the closure of my loans which were settled on 16th June. I believe an explanation of these fees must be provided urgently yet no one seems to know who can provide it.  I have also been trying to get a copy of a letter which should have been sent to both me and Bruce regarding each of our 3 loans when our interest rate jumped up on 31/3. When I discussed this increase with ANZ staff back in May, he also agreed that a letter would have been sent to explain the reason for this jump (I assume something to do with new P&I and IO structures). ANZ staff has requested a copy of this letter several times but it still has not been provided ? they keep saying it has been posted but it is not possible to get lost in the mail this many times so there must be some other issue at ANZ.  I paid $395 for my package in January and I still have a credit card and ANZ One account, therefore I expect to be able to get basic service from ANZ. The last 2 months have been very frustrating and nothing has been accomplished even though myself and ANZ staff have spent a considerable amount of time on the phone to different departments.  ANZ still hold the title for 47 Hawson Ave, North Plympton. This property was required originally as security for other loans but due to the increase in value of the other properties, they can now stand on their own. I would like to use my home again for a new loan so please organise to complete a free valuation to provide me with a guide of what I could borrow. Lastly, I have spoken to ANZ through many avenues, including Byron to have Bruces name corrected in your mailing address. He is addressed as Mr B C G Hocking. C and G are my initials ? Bruces initial is J for James. Recent statements and letters still have this error and I can not understand why it is not able to be corrected.","Firstly, please accept our sincere apologies for the extended timeframe in addressing your concerns.    Thank you for the opportunity to investigate this matter and respond to your concerns. We have considered all the information as provided by you and known to ANZ.  We are sorry to hear about your recent experience; please be advise your feedback and suggestions have been recorded and will be provided to the concerned departments for review.  As requested, please find attached correspondence in relation to ANZ?s announced interest rate changes effective 31 March 2017.  The attachments have been password protected for security reasons; the password format would have been sent in an SMS to your mobile number prior to the issue of this email.  We have received confirmation that your ANZ Breakfree Package has now been cancelled as your no longer hold any loans with ANZ.  Your annual Breakfree fee was charged on 27 January 2017 and cancelled on 01 August 2017.  As a result, you are no longer eligible for the ANZ Breakfree benefits and have been charged the $10.00 account keeping fee on your ANZ account ending 4613.  ANZ calculations shows you have received the ANZ Breakfree benefits for seven months, therefore the amount of $164.60 has been refunded to your ANZ account ending 4613 for the remaining months.  Please allow two to three business days for the funds to clear.    ANZ does not provide valuation services.  ANZ will complete independent valuations when required to assess associated risks in line with our internal credit policy. These valuation reports are for internal purposes only.  Therefore, ANZ will waive any Valuation Administration Fee where required for ANZ?s internal purposes.   Finally in relation to the settlement fees charged at the time of the requested refinance to Westpac Banking Corporation, we have confirmed the following  -	the amounts collected at the settlement were only the ANZ fees being $160 discharge production fee and $160 settlement fee.  -	On 20/6/17 Westpac created the 3 PEXA workspaces for electronic settlement to occur on 3/7/2017 (one for each of the 3 properties) -	Therefore, $160 discharge production and $160 settlement fee should be charged for each workspace.  -	ANZ reduced the fees on the third settlement to be $0.01.    However, based on your recent experience, ANZ has agreed to refund one more fee of $320.00 as a once off goodwill as a final resolution to this complaint.  To accept the above resolution, please email yourfeedback@anz.com, quoting reference number 973393.

My issue was that I was standing in a que at a money exchange attempting to purchase $3,000.00 of U.S. currency. My card declined twice and therefore I needed to contact ANZ and seek immediate assistance. After more than 20 minutes, a gentleman picked my call up and proceeded to inform me that I only have a daily limit of $2,500.00. I told him that I needed more and I had substantial funds in your bank to cover this. On top of being extremely frustrated at waiting so long, he told me that he needed to escalate my issue and that wait would only take 3 minutes. More than 10 minutes later a girl by the name of Jazz answered my call. Unfortunately I was even more frustrated after more than 30 minutes waiting to resolve this problem. Jazz confirmed what I had already been told and I then requested that she increase my limit to $5,000.00 to which she told me that the `system' only had a daily limit of $2,500.00. I asked Jazz to `change the system' as I needed to access MY money. I appreciate that after all my frustrations and particularly that I was in the middle of a transaction I was somewhat demanding on Jazz, however I certainly apologised to Jazz early on in the conversation and I would like it noted that at no time was I rude or abusive. Jazz abruptly hung up on me leaving me with no resolve and nowhere to go.             I would like to know whether this sort of reaction is tolerated by ANZ, particularly from a `customer service' representative and if this is accepted behaviour and standard practice by ANZ customer service representatives? If this be the case and is supported by senior management of ANZ, please let me know and I will immediately close my accounts, pay out my mortgage and seek a more professional banking institution, one of which is somewhat more compassionate in these circumstances and one which does not tolerate obnoxious and rude behaviour from their front line customer service representatives.

I was told i would get 10,000 points for the inter product transfer. I still cannot see that on my statement. 2. When i accepted this account i was told the statement period would commence when the new card was activated, so that would mean until approx 25/8. Since ANZ decided to provide less benefits to customers as they will make less money due to the new ACCC rules and now there is a $5000 limit per statement, i have been strategic in what i purchase. To my horror i find out the statement ended early (on 19/8) and i was about to make a $2357 payment which i ended up making on Saturday which will now eat into the $5000 for the next statement, which means i will lose around 9000 points (as i have been given 4pts per $ until 1/11) and will have a flow on effect for each statement. This is as i was not informed properly and i find disappointing. 3. I asked for the annual fee to be waived for the first year as a good will and loyalty gesture based on the amount of time i have been with ANZ. The consultant was unable to do it which i found disappointing so i let it go.

I was sitting on the sofa which just on the left hand of the entrance, waiting for my husband, playing my mobile phone. My husband was asking about how to cancel the car insurance. After about one minute, a mid-age woman came to me and asked me whether I have some questions. I told her I am just waiting for my husband, and then she said nothing. At that time, a man could not get in, he tried to open the front door but he failed. Therefore, I thought there was some problem with the door, so my husband pressed the green button to open the door. Suddenly, that mid-age woman said they were close. I realized it was them that locked the door, so I said sorry to that mid-age woman. She said nothing to me. After 5 minutes, there was a girl tried to get in, I did not open the door, and that mid-age woman told her that they were closed. I thought it was the ending of this story! But it was not. I was sitting there and continuing to play my phone, at that time a man asked that mid-aged woman to open the front door to let him in.

34566,COM-99805,COM-99805_1,Credit decision declined,"Good afternoon Mr. Elliott,  I write in relation to a recent application for an extension of my equity facility.  I write to you personally as I have heard you on the radio and am very impressed with the open and accountable way you do your business.  I have been banking with ANZ for quite some time and indeed have a small holding in the company.  I originally purchased 500 shares when there was a program to reward shareholders with lower interest rates.  Since then I have added to that number and keenly follow the company's results.  As an investor I have a small loan that I negatively gear and buy equities with.  It is currently for $70000 but I wanted to extend it to $100000.  I dealt with a very nice man by the name of Nakul Sharma and he was most helpful and has tried to assist me in every way he could. The problem was, the policies ANZ has did not let him.  The reason for this was my current status.  I was employed by Victoria Police in 1988 but last year I suffered a mental injury.  It resulted in me taking the last six months off.  I am currently on workcover and the claim has been accepted.  Proof of this was provided.    I was asked for my return date.  I don't know it and neither do my treaters.  I am on a month to month plan with ongoing counselling.  When this was communicated I was asked what guarantee there was of my income.   Australian law provides that workcover can be paid out to 130 weeks.  I hope I will be fit within this time but if I am not I will probably be pensioned off.  Our pension provisions have a number of hurdles but, if granted, are able to sustain a decent lifestyle.  All of this is readily available information.  I was informed by Mr Sharma that I would need to get my employer to provide a guarantee of my income.  They will not do this.  I have produced payslips and the acknowledgment of my workcover claim but this is not enough it seems.    I understand the reason the bank has for not extending credit.  I am not, in any way, over extended. In fact, I have more than the money asked for in my redraw.  I wanted to increase the equity loan for tax purposes primarily and to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arose.  I trade though ANZ and have a portfolio that is well in excess of my equity loan.    As I say, I am not in dire need of this extension but did not think it would be an issue when I requested it.  I now see it is.    I am not asking for a reconsideration of the decision.  Whilst I do not like it, I will accept it.  I am asking you to have someone look at your policies and see whether your stance for people receiving workcover or compensation where they have been injured at work is fair and good for business.    I thank you for your time in considering this matter.  Should you wish to have anyone contact me, I am available on 0417 396 296 and would be happy to discuss this.
