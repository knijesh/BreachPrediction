On this same day, Moonee Ponds branch had lost all of their systems, had two aggressive customers in the branch at the time upsetting the other customers and Mrs Studd had to wait 2 hours to be served, Mrs Studd said she understands the mistake is possible being how messy and stressful the afternoon must have been for the staff working at the time. At the time of the account opening she left the branch empty handed without any paper work as she asked it be mailed to her home address which she would return to after being in Western Australia.   When the customer arrived back in Tasmania and visited the Ulverstone branch to check her interest earnt after some months she was furious to learn she only had an Access Advantage account which had not earnt any interest at all. Since finding that out at the Ulverstone branch we have changed the account for her however the customer has calculated she is out of pocket around $3000 in interest. She is absolutely devastated about this and is seeking compensation and she feels she was not listened to at the time. Myself and the Personal Banker here have apologised to her on many occasions trying to give as much support and empathy as possible. However, Mrs Studd wanted an apology and compensation provided from the Moonee Ponds Branch, we have contacted the Moonee Ponds branch to see if this can be arranged however she has only received this email and that is all at this stage.

12587,COM-479269,COM-479269_1,Customer is looking for refund of $700 for settlement of fixed Home loan which was calculated incorrectly.,"Concern# 1 Customer is looking for a refund of $700; On 29 September customer sold his house and repaid the ANZ mortgage. The mortgage consisted of 5 parts two were on variable rate and three were fixed rate. The variable loans were cleared as expected, but there was a charge payable on two of the fixed rates as the interest rates of the fixed rate higher than the then prevailing interest rates. There was no charge on the third fixed rate tranche as the fixed interest rate was lower than the then prevailing interest rate.  Details of the fixed rate tranches were as follows  1. Tranche 1 Fixed rate tranche maturing 18Sept19 at 4.99% giving a loss payable by customer  on the Fixed Rate of approx. $9k  2. Tranche 2 Fixed rate tranche maturing 27Nov18 with account number ending in 82682 at 4.29% giving a loss payable by customer on the Fixed Rate of $605.01  3. Tranche 3 Fixed rate tranche maturing 2Nov18 (i.e. the same month as the above Fixed Rate tranche) with account number ending in 83597 at 3.75% - no charge required for customer to pay as it was in-the-money.  It is reasonably simple to work out that the interest rate used to calculate the loss on Tranche 2 was approx. 3.95%. Given the 3.75% tranche matured in the same month, then the interest rate used to calculate the loss (or gain) on closing this tranche would also have been approx. 3.95% as well. By customer calculation, ANZ therefore profited by close to $700 from closing the 3.75% tranche and this profit should have then been paid to customer.   Customer was always aware in the lead up to the sale of the house that losses on Tranches 1 & 2 were out-of-the-money would be partially offset by a gain on Tranche 3 that was in-the-money. Customer was both surprised and upset that when Tranche 3 was closed, no gain was paid, despite ANZ making a gain on closing that tranche.

On 8 June 2017, we had the property revalued at $920,000. On the 28 June 2017, between our additional mortgage repayments and the new valuation, we had successfully brought the LVR to under 80% (79.96% to be exact). This was within 12 months of paying the LMI premium. On 5 January 2018, we paid out the entire mortgage as we sold the property. This is within 24 months of paying the LMI premium. Our intention was to pay out the mortgage within the first 12 months to receive a rebate of the LMI premium we paid by terminating the policy, however when we spoke to several ANZ staff members, we were advised that we would not be entitled to any rebate of the LMI premium due to ANZ policy. This was very disappointing, as other mortgage insurers give rebates where the policy is terminated within the initial 12 / 24 months. We were not informed of the ANZ policy of no rebate when we paid the premium. Of concern is that ANZ is insured by ANZ mortgage insurance  effectively, ANZ self-insures. According to Finance Brokers Association of Australia president Peter White, LMI is an insurance product and as a result you should get a proportional rebate when its terminated. As the lender has the right to claim on the policy for the entire life of the mortgage, when the insurance policy is terminated, so is the risk. As with other insurance premiums, where the insurance is terminated, a portion of the premium is refunded. If we paid $31,643 in LMI for a policy for the life of our loan and we were in a position to clear the loan through refinance (with a LVR of <80%) in the first 12 months, and we went on to completely terminate the loan within the first 24 months through a sale of the property, we believe we are entitled to some form of pro-rata refund on the insurance premium paid. Failing to do so is not good practice. The amount sought is 50% of the LMI premium paid. Given we were in a position to have the LVR below 80% in the first 12 months of the loan, and we cleared the loan inside the first 24 months, I believe a 50% refund of the premium, in line with industry practice of other mortgage insurers, is fair and reasonable.",$9371 LMI refund plus $1k good will payment,14a,"My husband and I were approved a mortgage whereby we paid a significant premium for LMI due to a LVR above 80%.The mortgage was drawn down on 1 July 2016.

It has been linked to my Mother's internet banking without either of our permission.  Last year my Mum discovered that she can see this Savings account of mine along with her ANZ accounts under her internet banking. Her name is Antoinette Laria. We do not understand how this has happened as we do not have the same surname, have not had joint accounts and have not lived at the same address for almost ten years.   I emailed ANZ through my internet banking to request an explanation about this and the response was that my Mum was added as a signatory and that the only way that could have been done was that I would have filled out a form and that I needed to go into a branch to verify the form.  I had not filled out a form to request this and I do not understand why a signatory would be linked to the account and could see the account through their own internet banking anyway.  I went into the Mentone branch with my Mother to check the from they were talking of, but  I was told there was no way to trace the form or when the account had been linked and there was nothing they could do.  The branch staff member was completely unhelpful and showed that ANZ care nothing about privacy.  The trip was a complete waste of time, especially as it is not easy for myself and my Mum to get to a branch at the same time, and after contacting ANZ about the matter now twice I still had no answers.  My Mum wrote a complaint to ANZ but received yet another unsatisfactory response.    I have kept this account open so ANZ can investigate and so we can receive a satisfactory explanation about how this has happened.  In doing so I have ended up wasting $5 a month on account fees, for an account that is not use, whilst waiting.   My Mother and me are extremely upset with ANZ as this is a HUGE breach of privacy and are just absolutely baffled at how ANZ could allow this to happen. We are also now extremely worried that this could happen again and worse, with a stranger's account. And to think that someone has had access to my Savings account, not just access to transfer funds but to view my private transactions, is very upsetting and should not have happened. We have both been ANZ customers for many years and extremely disappointed and hoping ANZ understands the gravity of it.  I myself have recently moved our Mortgage, credit cards and Savings accounts to another bank as I was just fed up with ANZ disappointing and angering me and this was the last straw.  I will be closing all my accounts and credit cards with ANZ once this is resolved.  I really would like an explanation and assurance it will not happen in future.

Cust. would like this period to be extended to 18 mths.,"To whom it may concern, Re Ryan & Nicole John - Account Number 460269123 We recently went ahead with the process of a balance transfer from existing cards to our ANZ Platinum card. Before going through with this process, I called ANZ direct to confirm we could infact go ahead with the balance transfer and that we qualify for the 18 months interest free term. The very nice and helpful lady I was speaking to left me on hold to find out this information, came back and said we would get the 18 months interest free term once transferred. With that, we put in an application to go ahead - there was apparently an issue with the paper work but we just called ANZ and the man processed it manually for us. Recently we received our statement and it said we had a 12 month interest free period as opposed to the 18 months as promised, we called immediately and were told that we couldn't have the 18 months as our home loan package made us exempt. That is not really fair, we called specifically to find out that it was all fine to go ahead with the transfer and it was not honoured. The 18 month term suited us very well as we're now a single income family and it would help to relieve a bit of financial pressure. We have been loyal ANZ customers even changing our land mortgage over from IMB and would just appreciate the 18 month interest free term being reinstated on our balance transfer.

28977,COM-511507,COM-511507_1,DISPUTED TRANSACTION,"Registration  Dispute summary On 23 May 2018, my father received several calls from an individual claiming to be from ANZ and seeking information that seemed suspicous. My mother rang ANZ to ask if the caller was from ANZ. They stated the caller was not. ANZ cancelled my father's credit card at this point. After my mother expressed concern, ANZ stated any losses would be reimbursed to my parents. Upon checking the accounts online that afternoon, it was noted that 3 amounts totalling $7079.50 were listed as payments pending to 'Worldremitmoneytransfer Auckland' for the 24 May. My mother again contacted the ANZ to notify them of this and was again reassured that ANZ was aware of the situation. Given this, my parents took no further action at this time. When the accounts were checked again on 11 June, it was noted that the amounts had been transferred out of the account and had not been reimbursed. When ANZ were contacted again, they stated that it was now their position that the transfers were legitimate. It was implied my parents had somehow authorised the transfers. They were told 3 SMS's had been sent to them demanding a reply to STOP the transfers occuring. My parents deny receiving any messages, were not told by ANZ to expect any such messages and would have regarded any such messages they did receive as highly suspicous given the incident began with unsolicated phone calls in the first place. ANZ stated they would not reimburse the stolen money. It was suggested, for the first time, that a complaint be made to the police. This was done at Belmont Police Station (event number E295971094). It is our position that having been made aware of the threat to the account very promptly and lacking any action on the part of my parents to contribute to the loss, this situation falls well within the terms of ANZ's own 'Fraud Money Back Guarantee' (listed on their website). As such the lost funds should be reimbursed to them as soon as possible. Claim amount 7,079.50 Outcome requested Reimbursement of the $7079.50 transferred out of my parents account on 24/6/2018 plus consideration for reimbursement of interest paid in the intervening time. Any further information",,15,"Registration  Dispute summary On 23 May 2018, my father received several calls from an individual claiming to be from ANZ and seeking information that seemed suspicous. My mother rang ANZ to ask if the caller was from ANZ. They stated the caller was not. ANZ cancelled my father's credit card at this point. After my mother expressed concern, ANZ stated any losses would be reimbursed to my parents. Upon checking the accounts online that afternoon, it was noted that 3 amounts totalling $7079.50 were listed as payments pending to 'Worldremitmoneytransfer Auckland' for the 24 May. My mother again contacted the ANZ to notify them of this and was again reassured that ANZ was aware of the situation. Given this, my parents took no further action at this time. When the accounts were checked again on 11 June, it was noted that the amounts had been transferred out of the account and had not been reimbursed. When ANZ were contacted again, they stated that it was now their position that the transfers were legitimate. It was implied my parents had somehow authorised the transfers. They were told 3 SMS's had been sent to them demanding a reply to STOP the transfers occuring. My parents deny receiving any messages, were not told by ANZ to expect any such messages and would have regarded any such messages they did receive as highly suspicous given the incident began with unsolicated phone calls in the first place.

29360,COM-512259,COM-512259_1,Customer claiming incorrect information provided by branch manager around ability to sell property for lower value than total amount led to hardship and lost sale of investment property,"Dear ANZ, My name is Brendan de Glanville, I currently have two mortgages with your bank. These total over 1 million dollars. I unfortunately recently recognized my inability to pay one of these, which is my investment property at 1 Ceres Pl, Coolbellup. On the 28th April 2016, I received an offer for $465,000 for the property (please see attached offer, feel free to contact the agent also). I was happy to proceed with this offer. I called branch manager Mario Dilber who I had been dealing with and he mentioned that as my entire loan was approx. $530,000 I could not sell. I queried this and offered numerous alternatives to solve this, whether paying off the remainder in terms of a loan, adding the difference to my other home etc. The response was that I could not accept this offer. This was heartbreaking for me to hear as I have been trying to sell this property for close to 4 years and this was the only offer I have received all this time. Fast forward to present day over two years later when joining the financial hardship program, I am advised by one of your staff members after explaining past history advises me that ANZ cannot stop me from selling the property even if it does not clear the loan in it's entirety. Meaning that I could have accepted the offer and sold the property for $465k like I so desperately needed to. I could not believe this and was physically sick to hear this information. If I was informed that it was fine to accept the offer I received in 2016 then financial hardship discussions wouldn't have been entered into. I currently have fallen behind payments and now with legal. I would also like to bring to your attention that on two separate occasions I called the financial hardship team and was told there was no one to take my call so to leave my name and number and I would received a phone call back. I also sent an email for a return call I have received nothing. I went into a branch and got told they cannot do anything I have to speak to the legal group that is looking after my account now. Despite being a customer of ANZ for possibly 20 years, this service I have received has not been acceptable and I will be considering moving my accounts and mortgages elsewhere. With a wife and three young children to support I am not able to make the repayments of the house, hence pre-empting this in 2016 I was ready to sell. It is clear I am in this whole predicament as your staff member failed to provide the correct information. With the new information provided by the financial hardship team the property is again currently for sale, no offers have been provided. I am under a huge amount of financial stress due to this situation. This situation only occurring due to incorrect information given by one of your bank managers therefor forcing me not to sell my property and having to continue to struggle to pay a loan I cannot afford.

Customer then advised that the money transferred have still not cleared, I explained that she would need to speak with NAB on this not ANZ.   Customer was not happy with my response in advising that the provision of $400.00 was not for her to buy takeaway items as this would exceed the amount, our intentions were to assist the customer over the 4 days ($100 per day) until the funds clear. Customer kept referring to $290.00 only considering she paid for the ticket. After review of the complaint I processed another credit of $110.00 to cover the fine she was charged as full and final resolution to the complaint.

32687,COM-97000,COM-97000_1,Poor service,"I have a complaint about what I consider to be very unsatisfactory service.      It concerns the closure of a Term Deposit Account (see above) in the name of Angela Gallent.      My role is simple - I am Ms Gallent's attorney, appointed under an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA). Ms Gallent is unwell, and is in residential care. She needs to have her affairs administered on her behalf. Hence my appointment.      I had previously attended at the Koornang Road, Carnegie branch of the ANZ Bank, where I furnished a certified copy of the EPOA as well as my driving licence, and provided my contact details. On that occasion, I was treated with courtesy and efficiency. It was made clear, and agreed to, that I was the person to whom all correspondences were to be forwarded in resect of the account.      The Term Deposit expired on Tuesday last, 1 August 2017.      On Friday 28 July 2017, I attended at the Patterson Lakes branch of the ANZ, the closest branch to my home. I again produced a certified copy of the EPOA and my driving licence, as well as the Term Deposit receipt, to the lady who attended me. She indicated that the EPOA was indeed recorded in the bank's system.      As certain payments needed to be made on Ms Gallent's behalf, I asked that the Term Deposit not be rolled over, and that the account be closed.      The lady appeared to be quite uninterested in dealing with me, and to have little knowledge of the necessary procedures or the bank's system. At first, she doubted that the EPOA authorised me to deal with the account, until she was assured by another staff member that indeed it did.    After some time, she accepted my instructions, and entered my request into the computer on her desk. I asked if, on 1 August, I could attend at the branch to collect the bank cheque for the principal and the accrued interest. She told me `No', saying that she was not sure where the bank cheque would be processed, and added that it would be posted out to me, possibly from head office.      I would have much preferred to have collected the bank cheque, however it seemed that I had no option. I specifically asked that it be posted to me at my home address, the address shown on the EPOA, namely 2/215 Thames Promenade, Chelsea Heights, Vic, 3196. She nodded, and I took this to mean that the bank cheque would indeed be posted to me.

32721,COM-97057,COM-97057_1,Access advantage fees,"I wish to express my disappointment after a disturbing conversation with a teller, in regards to my everyday account. I asked if she could direct me to an account which doesn't have me paying as much in fees... At EOFY my partner saw the fees that I had paid and simply said ""you need to address that - that is not right"" so, I asked the question. Can I add - he is with Westpac! After handing over my card, the teller simply said ""no - this account doesn't have fees, you can use it 500 times a day and there are NO fees..."". I asked her to look through my account history as I was certain there were MULTIPLE fees. Eventually she found some and I said ""yes - and that happens every single MONTH"". She was confused and said that's not right and as she was newish,she asked her fellow teller for her opinion. At the same time, I mentioned that I opened the account a very long time ago - 1999. She confirmed that date and then added ANZ no longer offers this type of account...and there is a similar style of product that I can have unlimited use of my card - WITHOUT FEES. I found this completely offensive and unbelievable to say the least! I asked ""if it's a very old product that has been superseded by something BETTER why hadn't I been moved over to the new style of account - as a LOYAL customer of almost 20 years?"" Who notifies me that ANZ has created a new account better than the one I am on? I have a 3 year old son so my life has changed considerably. I imagine this would be where the increase in fees has started; a difficult baby, struggling to leave the house and having limited cash on hand AND no longer working full time... So yes, I thought it was, ""just the way it is"", BUT then to find out there is a better account that, in the Teller's words I ""should"" be on..! Regardless, I fail to grasp why you would reward my 18 years loyalty by slugging me with fees EVERY MONTH that a new person who signs up with you today doesn't have to suffer? Do you not have CUSTOMER FOCUSED STAFF looking out for loyal, LONG TERM account holders that are unaware that the everyday workings of their account(s) could be greatly improved - simply by moving across to a modern product? Even Telstra offers that service...! It's alarming to think that if my partner hadn't commented on my fees paid, that I would STILL be in that position, and I ask you - until WHEN? ANZ would never have highlighted the fact to me and just continued to CHARGE ME TO USE MY OWN MONEY. At speed, you can tell me when a dodgy overseas transaction has hit my account but nobody highlights my account is full of dodgy fees that needn't be there!
